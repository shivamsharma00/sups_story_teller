DEEP SPACE A dark screen is lit up by twinkling stars . SON Baba? FATHER Yes, my son? SON Tell me a story. FATHER Which one? SON The story of home . A meteorite drifts into frame , heading towards tiny Earth off in the distance. FATHER Millions of years ago , a meteorite made of vibranium, the strongest substance in the universe struck the continent of Africa affecting the plant life around it. The meteorite hits Africa and we see plant life and animals affected by vibranium. FATHER (CONT'D) And when the time of man came , five tribes settled on it and called it Wakanda. The tribes lived in constant war with each other until a warrior shaman received a vision from the Panther goddess Bast who led him to the Heart Shaped Herb, a plant that granted him super human strength , speed, and instincts . A visual representation of the five tribes emerges as hands from the sand animation, and we see them unite, and then break apart as conflict arises . Bashenga rises above the conflict and eats the Heart Shaped Herb, proceeding to unite the tribes . FATHER (CONT'D) The warrior became King and the first Black Panther , the protector of Wakanda . (MORE) "b"FATHER (CONT'D) Four tribes agreed to live under the King's rule , but the Jabari tribe isolated themselves in the mountains . 2. We see the Jabari striding off towards the isolated mountain region. FATHER (CONT'D) The Wakandans used vibranium to develop technology more advanced than any other nation, but as Wakanda thrived the world around it descended further into chaos . We see images of war and slavery just outside Wakanda 's secretive border . FATHER (CONT'D) To keep vibranium safe, the Wakandans vowed to hide in plain sight, keeping the truth of their power from the outside world. We see the protective barrier rise around the Wakandan city, as we pull back on the Earth as it spins, now zooming in on another part of the world ..\xa2 SON And we still hide Baba? FATHER Yes. SON Why? EXT. LAKE MERRITT APARTMENT COMPLEX, OAKLAND -NIGHT -1992 Towering apartment buildings loom over the horizon .

Suddenly, N'Jobu hears something that we don't ... a familiar sound. N'JOBU (CONT'D) Hide the straps. James quickly moves into action, hiding the guns in the walls as N'Jobu peers out a window, then clears the maps from the table and unrolls a tapestry on the wall, hiding a bulletin board. James cocks a handgun. JAMES Is it the Feds? N'JOBU No. A KNOCK rattles the door. James walks over and looks out of a peep hole, then turns back with a confused expression . JAMES It's two Grace Jones looking chicks \xa2.. they're holding spears ... N'JOBU Open it. JAMES You serious? N'JOBU They won't knock again. James opens the door and TWO DORA MILAJE (members of the All Female Wakandan Special Forces) slowly enter carrying LARGE SPEARS. They eye N 'Jobu. DORA MILAJE 1 (SUBTITLE) (in Xhosa) Who are you? N'JOBU Prince N'Jobu, son of Azzuri . "b"DORA MILAJE 1 (in Xhosa) Prove to me you are one of us. 4. N'Jobu grabs his bottom lip and flips it, revealing a vibranium threaded TATTOO glowing blue with Wakandan script. The Dora SWIFTLY SLAM their spears down in unison , making the sound of an EMP. All electronics in the room instantly DIE OUT. INT. N'JOBU'S APARTMENT - NIGHT The room is pitch black , then ... BOOM. The Dora hit the floor with their spears again and the lights come back ON , but now YOUNG T 'CHAKA (dressed in t he ceremonial garb of the Black Panther) stands before them .

N'JOBU This is James . I trust him with my life. He stays , with your permission , King T'Chaka . Young T'Chaka looks at him for a long beat . YOUNG T 'CHAKA As you wish. At ease .\xa2. Young T 'Chaka removes his mask , hands it off to the Dora and the women step out into the hall , closing the door behind them. YOUNG T 'CHAKA (CONT'D) (in Xhosa) Come baby brother .

How is home? Young T'Chaka's mood darkens. YOUNG T'CHAKA Not so good , baby brother. There has been an attack. Then, Young T'Chaka activates a simple looking beaded bracelet, KIMOYO BEADS , that project a hologram image of ULYSSES KLAUE . YOUNG T'CHAKA (CONT'D) This man , Ulysses Klaue , stole a quarter ton of vibraniurn from us and triggered a bomb at the border to escape . Many lives were lost . He knew where we hid the vibranium, and how to strike . N'Jobu takes the news in . YOUNG T'CHAKA (CONT'D) He had someone on the inside. 5. Young T'Chaka waits for N 'Jobu to come clean of the crime .

JAMES (ZURI) You betrayed Wakanda! N'JOBU How could you lie to me like -YOUNG T'CHAKA Stand down. Did you think that you were the only spy we sent here? Zuri walks to the wall and removes a duffle bag containing VIBRANIUM CANISTERS , glowing blue . He shows one to Young T'Chaka . YOUNG T'CHAKA (CONT'D) Prince N'Jobu, you will return home at once, where you will face the council and inform them of your crimes. EXT.

She moves towards the back of the craft . T'CHALLA No need, Okoye. I can handle this alone. Okoye pauses, then returns her spear to the wall. T'Challa closes the model and steps to a marked circle in the floor. T'CHALLA (CONT 'D) I will get Nakia out as quickly as possible . Okoye places six KIMOYO BEADS into T'Challa's gloved hands. OKOYE Just don't freeze when you see her . T'CHALLA What are you talking about? I never freeze. "b"8.

Slowly approaching , the militant leader points to SHIFTING FOLIAGE in the direction of Panther. The militants nod and the militant leader covers them while they go off into the grass. The militants move slowly following every sound . They point their guns at the base of a TREE, but it 's just a stray DOG.

DIRT CLEARING, CHIBOCK - NIGHT The four men don't see Panther coming and executing a BARRAGE OF PUNCHES AND KICKS, Panther viciously dispatches them. He spots the Young Militant firing at him then SLASHES through a car door, and THROWS THE DOOR at a Militant behind him\xc2\xadtaking him out. ON PANTHER In a moment of desperation , the Young Militant rushes out , firing at Panther to no effect. Then , as Panther walks towards him, Nakia dives out , kicking the young militant's gun from his hand and grabs him in a neck-lock. Swinging around , Nakia kicks Panther in the chest, stopping his momentum. Caught off guard, Panther freezes . NAKIA This one is just a boy ... he got kidnapped as well. Nakia pulls the wrap from the young militant's face, exposing his pre-teen expression. She removes her own hijab as well. Panther stares at her-for a beat too long ... T'CHALLA Nakia ... I ...

T'CHALLA Update? No , it worked perfectly . SHUR! How many times to I have to teach you, just because something works , doesn't mean that it cannot be improved .

WEST AFRICAN EXHIBIT - MOMENTS LATER We see a black man in high-end street wear , around 30 years old. A RING hangs on a gold chain around his neck . This is ERIK KILLMONGER . Killmonger stands dangerously close to the glass containing SEVERAL WEST AFRICAN ARTIFACTS . They range from what looks like iron gardening tools to masks and short range weapons. Flanking the room are TWO SECURITY GUARDS , slightly unnerved by his presence . We follow the MUSEUM DIRECTOR , a British woman (mid-40's) as she enters and walks up behind Killmonger as he studies t he war masks . MUSEUM DIRECTOR Good morning ! How can I help you? KILLMONGER I was just checking out these artifacts . They tell me you're the expert. MUSEUM DIRECTOR You could say that. KILLMON GER They're beautiful . Killmonger points at one of the masks .

"b"MUSEUM DIRECTOR Also from Benin . 7th Century. Fula tribe I believe . KILLMONGER Nah. MUSEUM DIRECTOR (amused) I beg your pardon? KILLMONGER It was taken by British soldiers in Benin but it's from Wakanda and it's made out of vibranium . Don't trip, I'mma take it off your hands for you. She looks at Killmonger like he's crazy . MUSEUM DIRECTOR These items aren't for sale. KILLMONGER How do you think your ancestors got these? You think they paid a fair price? Or did they take it like they took everything else . MUSEUM DIRECTOR Sir, I'm going to have to ask you to leave . 16. The Museum Director subtly looks back at the security guards, then makes a face and touches her stomach --indigestion . Killmonger smiles and leans over, whispering in her ear . KILLMONGER You got all this security watching me ever since I walked in. But , you ain't checking for what you put in your body . The museum director looks at Killmonger in terror as a security guard walks up behind him . SECURITY GUARD Alright, mate. Let's have it . Come on, mate. KILLMON GER I think she might not be feelin' too good . "b"17. The Museum Director suddenly slumps to the floor, clutching her stomach . KILLMONGER (CONT'D) Hey! Hey somebody get some help !

Museum-goers quickly bee line for the exit as Klaue approaches the guards. "b"18. Uneasy, the security guards follow Klaue's instructions only to have KLAUE AND LIMBANI draw silenced pistols and rapidly shoot two of the three dead . Klaue looks at the one remaining. KLAUE Hey come here. Come here! It 's ok. You can go , but just don't tell anyone, alright? The SECURITY GUARD looks back at him unsure, then takes off. Klaue then aims and shoots the Security Guard in the back . Killmonger looks on at him confused . KILLMONGER Bro, why you 'aint just shoot him right here? KLAUE Because it's better to leave the crime scene more spread out ... makes us look like amateurs . The LENS on a surveillance camera at the corner of the room looks on. INT.

Klaue removes his glove to reveal a BIONIC PROSTHETIC hand . "b"19. Klaue walks up to the PROTECTIVE GLASS surrounding a smaller case containing the mining tool and places his hand on it . An invisible charge SHATTERS the glass. KLAUE (CONT 'D) That's just a taste . Klaue picks up the MINING HAMMER , studying it . The tool doesn't look like anything special . Klaue's hand SIZZLES BLUE and centuries of MUCK and GRUNGE drop off the hammer revealing that it's pure vibraniurn . Klaue smells it , and smiles. KLAUE (CONT'D) Whoo ..\xa2 You're gonna be rich , boy. KILLMON GER You better sel l that quick . KLAUE Oh it's already sold . Klaue waves Lirnbani over with the stretcher to load the hammer inside . He BREAKS the WOODEN HANDLE off the tool , taking only the vibranium head . KILLMONGER Whatever you try , the Wakandans 'll probably show up . KLAUE That'll make my day . I can kill two birds with one stone . Lirnbani approaches Killmonger who eyes a third MASK , expertly crafted and slightly haunting . He slides th e mask inside the stretcher also.

ZURI I, Zuri, Son of Badu, give to you, Prince T'Challa , the Black Panther! The Elders watch as Zuri holds up A CEREMONIAL VESSEL containing a mysterious concoction . ZURI (CONT'D) The Prince will now have the strength of the Black Panther stripped away . Zuri pours the solution into T'Challa's mouth . T'Challa reacts violently, choking on the red fluid. T'Challa spasms, his veins expanding and his muscles contracting as the poison spreads through him . But soon, he stops shaking and exhales easy . Zuri turns to the audience . ZURI (CONT'D) Damaku ... CROWD Damaku ... ZURI Victory in ritual combat comes by yield or death . If any tribe wishes to put forth a warrior, I now offer a path to the throne .

As she raises her hand, and a collective gasp is heard amongst the entire gathering . SHUR! This corset is really uncomfortable. So could we all just wrap it up and go home? Ramonda pinches her, as the ELDERS groan, and the YOUNG WAKANDANS can be heard laughing . BACK IN THE POOL T'Challa smiles and shakes his head . The sound of WOODEN DRUMS and loud chanting suddenly interrupts . 22. Everyone looks to the mouth of the main CAVE where SIX JABARI WARRIORS and TWO JABARI DRUMMERS file out. Adorned in elaborate wooden armor, the warriors hold large wooden spears that look like javelins . The Kingsguard coil tightly as stunning the CROWD , the Jabari's imposing leader, M'BAKU , emerges last . "b"ON THE AUDIENCE Where W'Kabi and Nakia unsheathe their weapons and Okoye readies the Dora Milaje . ON SHURI AND RAMONDA Shuri turns to her mother . SHURI (CONT'D) Are they Jabari? RAMONDA Yes.

We have watched with disgust , as your technological advancements have been overseen by a child who scoffs at tradition . 23. M'Baku points his spear at Shuri, who's eyes grow large. AYO steps in front of her . M'BAKU (CONT'D) And now ... you want to hand the nation over to this prince ... (he steps nose to nose with T'Challa) Who could not even keep his own father safe . Hmm? We will not have it. I said we will not have it ! (beat) I, M'Baku, leader of the Jabari wish to T'CHALLA (interrupting) I accept your challenge, M'Baku. M'BAKU Glory to Hanuman . "b"24. Zuri puts the Panther mask on T'Challa . M'Baku grins and places a WOODEN GORILLA MASK over his face . He clenches his fist and calls out for his Jabari soldiers to form a semicircle behind him , pointing their spears at his back. T'Challa lifts his hand and calls out for the Dora, who fall into place behind him, making a perfect CIRCLE OF SPEARS surrounding the fighters. Zuri raises his hand, ill-at-ease . ZURI Let the challenge begin! The warriors CLASH, both with great skill . M'Baku with superior strength. T'Challa eludes a salvo of swings, then is driven back by the tip of M'Baku's spear against his shield. Knocking M'Baku's spear free, T'Challa is HAMMERED ONTO HIS BACK but instantly springs up to dodge more attacks and counter with TWO FIERCE KICKS. M'Baku spits blood and bangs his chest. The rest of the Jabari warriors RESPOND. T'Challa salutes the crowd and they respond LOUDER! M'Baku charges at T'Challa , knuckle-walking , and slipping his assault , T'Challa grabs M'Baku's spear and cartwheels over it to land another KICK. The two continue to battle, BLOCKING and TRADING BLUNT STRIKES , until M'Baku delivers a backhand that KNOCKS T'CHALLA OFF HIS FEET near the Dora's spears. With the deadly spears at his back, T'Challa blocks COLOSSAL OVERHEAD BLOWS with his shield, then M 'Baku leans with all his strength trying to impale T'Challa on the TIPS. Clubbing M'Baku to his heels , T'Challa rushes forward for an aerial attack only to be met by a VICIOUS KICK to the chest , causing him to LOSE both his shield and spear! M'BAKU Where is your God, now?! Defenseless, T'Challa DODGES SPEAR-SWIPES before M'Baku corrals him into a BEAR HUG and delivers a CRUSHING HEADBUTT. M'Baku LAUGHS through his mask . "b"M'BAKU (CONT 'D) No powers . No claws . No special suit, oh! Just a boy, not fit to lead. EXT. SEATING AREA, WARRIOR FALLS -DAY From T'Challa's POV we see Ramonda cheering from the sidelines.

You can do this T'Challa ! BACK IN THE CHALLENGE POOL T'Challa wedges M'Baku 's spear UNDER HIS FOOT and PULLS M'Baku to the pool , FLIPPING his body into a SERIES OF LEG CHOKES. M'Baku FIGHTS, but can't escape . T'CHALLA Yield! Don't make me kill you . M'BAKU I would rather die ! T'Challa TIGHTENS HIS GRIP and M'Baku begins to fade . T'CHALLA What would the proud Jabari do without you? T'Challa tightens further. "b"T'CHALLA (CONT 'D) You have fought with honor , now yield! Your people need you . M'Baku looks up at the Jabari warriors . T'CHALLA (CONT'D) Yield, man ! M'Baku grudgingly reaches out and TAPS . 26. T'Challa lets him go and is barely ab le to stand h imself as Zuri steps forward .

T'CHAKA (CONT'D) (in Xhosa) What is wrong my son? T'CHALLA (in Xhosa) I am not ready, Baba. T'CHAKA (in Xhosa) Have you not prepared to be King your whole life? Have you not trained and studied, been by my side? T'CHALLA That is not what I am talking about. I am not ready to be without you.

I can't be happy here knowing that there's people out there who have nothing . T'Challa thinks on this . "b"T'CHALLA What would you have Wakanda do about it? Nakia thinks for a bit . NAKIA Share what we have. We could provide aid and access to technology and refuge to those who need it ... other countries do it, we do it better. T'CHALLA We are not like these other countries, Nakia. If the world found out what we truly are, and what we possess -- we could lose our way of life. NAKIA Wakanda is strong enough to help others and protect ourselves at the same time . Nakia gives T'Challa a look . T'CHALLA If you were not so stubborn you would make such a great queen.

T'CHALLA Foreign aid ... refugee programs. W'Kabi shakes his head. W'KABI You let refugees in , they bring their problems with them. And then Wakanda is like everywhere else. T'Challa thinks on this. W'KABI (CONT'D) Now, if you said you wanted me and my men to go out there and clean up the world, then I'd be all for it. T'CHALLA But waging war on other countries has never been our way. Then, both of their Kimoyo beads buzz. T'CHALLA (CONT'D) You too, huh? W'KABI Bast, are we in trouble? Their beads combine to project a display of Okoye . 31. "b"OKOYE (DISPLAY) My King . My love.

Shuri picks the mannequin back up and drags it over to the same spot . SHUR! I invite you to my lab, and you just kick things around . "b"T'CHALLA Well maybe you should make it a little stronger , eh? 37. Shuri shrugs as we see Wakandan Script built into the suit GLOWING INDIGO where the impact of T'Challa's foot landed. T'Challa looks closely at the glowing script . T'CHALLA (CONT'D) Wait a minute . SHURI The nanites absorb the kinetic energy and hold it in place for redistribu tion. T'CHALLA Very nice. SHURI Now strike it again , in the same spot. T'Challa backs up for a kick. Shuri presses record on her Kimoyo. T'Challa sees this and looks at her suspiciously . T'CHALLA You are recording? SHUR!

In times of crisis , the wise build bridges , while the foolish build barriers . We must find a way to look after one another, as if we were one single tribe. The audience of WORLD LEADERS look around , bemused, wondering what Wakanda could possibly have to offer . A FRENCH AMBASSADOR can't help but lean into his microphone .

Promises to participate in global efforts to tackle international challenges, to share resources, technology and full technical cooperation concerning vibranium.(beat)Promises, Mr. Chairperson, that the Queen of Wakanda is failing to deliver on. The United States shares a deep concern over the lack of Wakandas transparency and urges meaningful dialogue in consultation with key partners and Wakanda to strengthen efforts to achieve our commitments to international development and security. Thank you, Mr. Chairperson.The Other Dignitaries nod in agreement. Ramonda looks back silently and strongly. CHAIRPERSON OF UNMy thanks to the Secretary of State of the United States of America for that statement. I now give the floor to the Minister of Foreign Affairs for France. SECRETARY OF STATE OF FRANCE (SUBTITLE)(in French)Thank you, Mr. Chairperson, France has information that states vibranium has limitless potential as a renewable energy source. And yet Queen Ramonda has still declined to open access to the material through international trade, or any of Wakandas  philanthropic ventures. We also have information that vibranium can be used to make weapons of mass destruction. It is a substance that does not trigger any known metal detector. It could be smuggled.

SECRETARY OF STATE OF FRANCE (SUBTITLE)(in French)I would like to put the question to her majesty. Why is there so much secrecy around this particular resource? If her nations intentions really are to help other nations, why is that help only extended to certain groups of people in those nations? And what of our intelligence in France, in Belgium, and in the United States, that vibranium has properties that can be weaponized? (beat)Mr. Chairperson, Wakanda has deliberately chosen, in a recurrent manner, to defy our collective security architecture. The durability of our international security would be at stake if we were to overlook the potential threat of vibranium today. Thank you, Mr. Chairperson.CHAIRPERSON OF UN My thanks to the Minister of Foreign Affairs for France. I now give the floor to her majesty, Queen Ramonda.Ramonda leans into her mic. RAMONDAThank you Mr. Chairperson, Wakandas offerings to the global community do not begin and end with our nations most valuable resource. It has always been our policy to never trade vibranium under any circumstance.

Raquel pulls Dennis out onto the dance floor. They sway. A lupine-featured GAULTIER GIRL with a streak of white running through her raven hair moves in behind Dennis, pressing up against him. Rachel Williams as the Angel of Death -- we'll call her MERCUR~. 4. Mercury flicks her tongue against Dennis' ear -- it's been pierced with a silver post which clicks against her teeth. Tattooed across her back is a swirling, black tribal vortex. Dennis is now sandwiched between Raquel and Mercury, the three of them dry-humping their way to every man's glory. The beat gets LOUDER. The action heavier. The atmosphere more narcotic. People are stri~ping off their clothes, sweating like fiends. It's a virtual orgy. \xc2\xb7 Dennis laughs, reveling in the hedonism. Everything rises to a fever pitch --DENNIS (over the music) Fuck, I need a drink!!! Raquel just smiles -- then Dennis notices a DROP OF SOMETHING spattering his hand. It looks like blood. Dennis looks up, concerned ---- MORE BLOOD DROPLETS are falling. Raquel's face is sprinkled with them now. Dennis stops danci~g. What is this? Raquel turns her face toward the ceiling, as if washing herself in a summer shower. Now the other club goers ~re looking up too --BLOOD SHOWERS DOWN from sprinkler heads in the ceiling, drenching the dancers. The club goers love it, thrusting their heads back, mouths open wide to receive the crimson offering. Horrified, Dennis recoils, turning towards --RAQUEL, whose face morphs, for one split-second, into a preternatural, canine-extended snarl. (CONTINUED) 11 "b"BLADE -Prod.

In fact, everyone in the club does. with the exception of poor Dennis. That's because they're~ vampires. Dennis tries to run, but the burly Doorman blocks his exit, brutally SMASHING his fist into Dennis' face. Dennis falls, dazed. The club-goers close in around him. They make a ~ame of it, shoving him from one person to another, their pale faces leering like twisted jack-o-lanterns. The strobe lights quicken to a seizure-inducing intensit\xc2\xa5\xc2\xb7 Dennis spins, tumbling into Raquel's arms. She shoves him forward -Dennis lands on the floor, falling at someone's boot-clad feet. He looks up. A DARl< FIGURE sits in the shadows, unnoticed until this moment. As the blood-shower drizzles to a stop above, the figure moves into the light. Time screeches to a halt --A BLACK MAN, 5 \xa2 towers above Dennis, wearing a leather longcoat -- a sneer of cruel contempt etched upon a face tempered by a lifetime of horror. His name is BLADE. Blade whips open his long coat, shrugging it off, revealing an arsenal of high-tech weapons strapped to his body: 6-point adjustable body armor, an assault rifle with an ultra-violet entry light, a pair of custom-made, hand-tooled MACH autos -- raw, unfinished, unpolished -- made for killing, not show. In addition, Blade has a custom automatic cross-bow, a bandoleer of gleaming, silver stakes, an Indian-style katar punching dagger -- and last, but certainly not least, his namesake -- a sword which is secured in a back-scabbard. CLOSE ON BLADE A gaze as cold and pitiless as a midnight sun. The vampire club-goers stare back. Nuclear silence. And then --All hell breaks loose.

He holsters the MACH autos, swings up his assault rifle, calmly flicks on the T.N entry light mounted above MERCURY races across the room -- we\'ve never seen anythin~ move so fast. Blade\'s rounds stitch a line of FIREPOWER Just behind her, but she vanishes through a doorway. THE OTHER VAMPIRES surge towards Blade. He retaliates -- a shaft of blinding UV "sunlight" cutting across them. They rear back, skin smoking from the light\'s corrosive effects. Blade o~ens FIRE, pumping round after round of wooden fragmentation bullets into the crowd -- vampire genocide. The strobe lights flicker as the mayhem mounts: Some of the vampires try to flee, scurrying up the stairs, but the exit quickly becomes clogged with incinerating bodies -- then Blade\'s rifle jams. He drops the rifle, reaches over his shoulder and -SCHIN.GGG! -unsheathes his sword with a double-handed grip. THE SWORD Four acid-etched feet of blood-soaked titanium alloy. An edge so sharp it could cleave a shadow in two. Blade moves like lightning, hacking his way into TWO CHARGING VAMPIRES, cutting one of them clean in half ON THE FAR END OF THE CLUB, a LATEX-CLAD VAMP makes a break for it. Blade flings his sword, sending it spinning end over end -- THUNK! The sword punches into the vampire\'s heart. The hellish creature combusts, dies. Beat. Blade retrieves his sword, then senses -\xc2\xadSOMETHING rising up behind him. In a flash, Blade swings his sword downward, cutting off the vampire\'s right hand at the elbow.

Blade flies backwards thirty feet, tumbling over tables, slamming into the rear wall so hard that plaster rains down from the ceiling. 7 \xa2 Blade suddenly finds himself wrestling with a feral-faced, knife-wielding ni9htmare named QUINN. Wild eyes, truly insane. The vampire rears back its head, stabbing the knife repeatedly into Blade's (armored) chest --Blade SMASHES Quinn across the face, knocking him back across the room. Quinn rises up, charging again --Blade unholsters the cross-bow secured to his leg. With a flick of a switch the arms of the bow -SNAP!- open, drawing the bow-string taut. Blade FIRES --The bolt hits Quinn in the shoulder, catching him mid-air, throwing him backwards and nailing him to the wall. As Quinn reaches over with his other hand to pull out the stake Blade FIRES AGAIN. A second bolt slams into Quinn's other arm, effectively pinning him like a butterfly to\xc2\xb7 a board. Blade strides over. BLADE Quinn. I'm getting a little tired of hacking you into pieces --Blade sheathes his sword. QUINN (snarling) Fuck you, Blade. You just got lucky this time --Blade unclips an incendiary device from his combat harness, arming it --BLADE Thought I'd try fire for a change. Quinn unleashes a stream of vampire invectives.

As Blade approaches, he cringes back DENNIS Please don\'t --Blade simply 9rabs Dennis by the jaw, tilting his head upward, rotating it from side to side -- looking for bite marks. There aren\'t any. Just then, we hear the sound of APPROACHING SIRENS. Blade looks up sharply. From the stairs we can hear CARS STOPPING, FOOTSTEPS ON THE STAIRS as the POLICE enter, swarming into the club. THEIR POV All evidence of the vampires is gone, with the exception of a few piles of ash and the blood-drenched walls -\xc2\xadeverything else has been burned away by the acidic process of the creatures\' accelerated decomposition. As for Blade, he\'s nowhere to be found. Quinn is still nailed to the wall, HOWLING \xc2\xb7as he burns. 8. PARAMEDICS rush past the Police, training their fire extinguishers on Quinn. By the time the CO2 mist dies down, though, Quinn is nothing but a charred "scorpse". PARAMEDIC #1 (gagging) Christ, what a mess! Meanwhile, the Police have surrounded Dennis. POLICEMAN #1 What happened here? (re: Quinn) Who did this?! Dennis can only stammer, still terrified. 12 EXT.

KAREN (re: microscope) Look at this blood smear Curtis takes a look for himself. KAREN The red blood cells are biconvex, which is theoretically impossible. They're hypochromic, there's virtually no hemoglobin in them. (shaking her head) Look at the PMNs, they're binucleated, ~hey should be mononucleated. Curtis taps a computer print-out he's holding.

Curtis and Karen, each garbed in a mask, stand on either side of Quinn\'s body, which now rests on the autopsy table. QUINN\'S BODY A preliminary exploratory Y-incision has been made across the chest, stretching from s\xc2\xb7houlder to shoulder, then continuing on down the abdomen. Ribs and cartilage have been cut open to expose the heart and lungs. KAREN You haven\'t started in on the internal organs? CURTIS Just the blood sample from the pericardial sac.

Strikingly handsome, younger, less conservative than his superiors, fueled with a passionate intensity. Amongst the vampire community he\'s known as an agitator. He\'s also the vampire equivalent of a racial supremacist. At the moment, though, Frost looks more like a smug schoolboy who\'s been sent to see the principal. He takes a look around the room, then bows his head in mock penitence. FROST (in English) Forgive me Father, fer apparently I have sinned. \xc2\xb7 DRAGON ETTI (subtitled, taking umbrage) You refuse to speak our language, you insult the House of Erebus by using the humans\' gutter-ton9ue. Have you no respect for tradition? Frost lifts his head and matches Dragonetti\'s gaze. FROST Why should I respect something which has outlived its purpose? This causes quite a stir amongst the other vampires. Frost might as well have slapeed Dra9onetti in the face. The conversation continues 1n English from this point on.

Then he presses the pistol-injector against Blade's carotid artery. Blade shakes violentlr, grinding his teeth through the bite guard, veins cording in his neck. He clutches Whistler's hand, holding it tightly as he fights his way through the hellish seizure. To his credit, Whistler never lets go. Mentor and student stare at one another as the mysterious serum runs its violent course.

I have blood samples. I can show them. BLADE They've infiltrated the police. You'd be dead before you could file the complaint. KAREN That's ridiculous! No one's that powerful. Whistler sighs. He doesn't suffer fools gladly. WHISTLER You're talki~g about a brotherhood that predates tha catholic Church by thousands of years. Chances are, you've encountered them and not even known it.

Blade follows the vampire's eyes to an armored door, then he stands back, handing the UV rig to Karen. BLADE If he moves, cook him. Blade approaches the vault door, sizing up its locking mechanism.

The vampires fling Blade against the vault wall, pinning him. QUINN You took my arm, Blade. But that\'s okay, I\'m growing a new one --Quinn lifts up his "arm".

WHISTLER stands in the smoking hole where the wall used to be, brandishing his cane in one hand and an automatic rifle in the other.

It's been slow --BLADE You don't look so good. KAREN I'm just tired, that's all. We've been up all night. 70. Blade nods, not buying her explanation. He shoots a glance to Whistler, which doesn't go unnoticed by Karen. KAREN Excuse me. Karen turns, heading for the back of the workshop. 85 INT. WORKSHOP - BATHROOM - NIGHT Karen enters a dingy bathroom, turning on the overhead bulb. She studies her reflection in the mirror above the sink, then grimaces as she peels the dressing from her wound -\xc2\xadthe wound is clearly infected, gangrenous. BLADE ( 0. S. ) It's started. Karen spins, startled. Bla<fe stands behind her. He grips her jaw, turning her head so he can better view the wound. BLADE You've got another day or t~o at most. Karen nods, shaken. As she moves to leave, Blade reaches for her arm, stopping her. !3LADE For what it's worth, I'~ sorry. KAREN You make it sound like I'm already dead. Blade exits, leaving Karen alone. Karen moves to a grimy bathroom window, watching the sun go down, an unmistakable look of dread creeping over her. CUT TO: 84 35 "b"BLADE - Prod. Draft - 9/19/96 86 EXT. LANDFILL GHETTO - DUSK Windy. Urban desolation. Blade stands on the perimeter of a sprawling cardboard and plywood squatter's ghetto which has sprung up around the city dump. CHILDREN and DOGS forage for salvageable items, while in the distance, dumptrucks grind over the dunes of refuse. MOMENTS LATER, 71. Blade is winding his way through the maze of makeshift homes and ashcan fires. A CROWD quickly closes in around him, suspicious. A BRUTISH MAN steps fon.'ard Extranjero. MAN 'Quien es? BLADE I'm here to see Miracia. Kam sent me. The man turns to his fellow squatters, WHISPERING. After a heated debate, a GAUNT WOMAN steps fon.'ard, motioning WOMAN This way. CUT TO: 87 INT. WHISTLER'S WORKSHOP - NIGHT Whistler and Karen sit at a work table. Karen is looking at a blood smear slide through a microscope. Whistler nods. KAREN All right, let's start with the basics -- why do vampires need to drink blood? WHISTLER Their own blood can't sustain hemoglobin. KAREN Then vampirism is a genetic defect, just like Hemolytic anemia? KAREN So what about gene therapy? Whistler looks intrigued. Karen continues. (CONTINUED) 86 87 "b"BLADE - Prod. Draft -9/19/96 87 CONTINUED: KAREN Basically you'd have to re-write the victim's DNA, alter it so that the DNA will produce proteins capable of generating hemoglobin. WHISTLER How? KAREN With a retrovirus. It's injected into the bone marrow cells, it causes the host's DNA to mutate. They've been using them to treat Sickle-cell anemia. Whistler can hardly believe what he's hearing. WHISTLER You're serious? You actually think this could work? Karen pauses we can see in her expression that there's something she's been holding back. KAREN On me, yes. On Blade, I'm not so sure --(gravely) The problem is, Blade didn't contract the vampire virus from a bite like I did. He was born with it. The irony is, I could probably cure every vampire but him. WHISTLER Then we're back to square one, aren't we? Sooner or later, the Thirst always wins. 72. At that moment, the lights in the workshop flicker, then go out. Karen looks around the room, alarmed. KAREN What happened to the power? WHISTLER (concerned) I don't know, but the back-up generator should've kicked in. A few seconds pass. The back-up generator still hasn't activated. Whistler moves to the window --(CONTINUED) 87 "b"BLADE - Prod. Draft - 9/19/96 87 CONTINUED: 2 WHISTLER tN floodlights are down too. As Whistler reaches for a flashlight we hear the sound of GLASS SHATTERING coming from the other end of the workshop. Whistler shines the flashlight in that direction. We hear MORE SOUNDS now -- WATER DRAINING, GLASS TINKLING. 73. Whistler raises a finger to his lips, signaling silence. He edges forward, Karen falling in behind him. THE TANK containing the vampire has been smashed open. It's empty now, with ~ust the steadily draining blood seeping across the floor 1n a widening pool -- and a trail of BLOODY FOOTPRINTS leading away. Karen scans the shadows. Whistler moves the flashlight in a slow circle, shining the beam over every inch of the room. And just as he's about to complete his circuit --THE ANCIENT VAMPIRE leaps from where it had been hiding overhead! Karen SCREAMS. Whistler is knocked to the floor, the flashlight spinning from his hand --The blood-soaked vam~ire lands atop Whistler, HISSING like a cobra. And just as it's about to strike -- ZZZZING! Whistler withdraws a silver rapier which had been hidden inside his cane. He lunges forward ---- but the vampire ducks beneath the sword thrust, throwing itself at back Whistler. As the two of them struggle, Whistler SCREAMS --Karen runs to a shelving unit where Whistler's weapons are stored, grabs one of the modified pistols. She tries to draw a bead on the creature -- FIRES, misses, FIRES again -- she's getting more unnerved as the seconds tick by and she can't get off a clean shot anymore because she might hit Whistler too and Karen hesitates now as --WHISTLER SHOOT IT!!! --suddenly it's right in front of her, rushing fop,ard, fangs bared! The vampire knocks Karen back against the wall. It's at her throat, sinking its claws into her neck, its pale face leering at her from behind a cowl of blood-slick hair. (CONTINUED) 87 "b'BLADE - Prod. Draft - 9/19/96 87 CONTINUED: 3 And just as it\'s about to bite ---- Whistler reaches in from behind, YANKING the vampire\'s head back, FIRING a pistol into its skull. The creature slumps --Karen cries out, disgusted, flinging the corpse away from her. As it continues to writhe --THUNK! Whistler swings his cane-rapier down on the creature, brutally decapitating it. Finishing the job. Then he looks to Karen, winded. WHISTLER Understand this -- they are monsters. Hesitate for even a moment, and you\'ve lost. FROST ( 0. S . ) Words to live by, Whistler. Whistler spins, eyes wide. He knows that voice. DEACON FROST steps into the pool of illumination thrown off by the flashlight, followed by Mercury and Quinn. FROST It\'s been a long time, hasn\'t it, "old friend"? 88 EXT .. LANDFILL GHETTO -MIRACIA\' S CABIN -NIGHT CUT TO: Blade is led to a ~lywood cabin crowded with candle-lit altars -- garish pictures of Saints and demons abound, alongside bottles of roots and herbs steeped in alcohol, human bones, voodoo dolls . MIRACIA sits on a sagging couch outside, clutching a deck of well-thumbed Bjcycle playing cards. She\'s ancient, with a mouthful of gold-capped teeth and cataract-clouded eyes. Blind. MIRACIA Is something wrong, my friend? BLADE I\'m sorry, I was hoping you\'d read something for me 74. (CONTINUED) 87 88 'b'BLADE - Prod. Draft - 9/19/96 88 CONTINUED: MIRACIA There are other ways to see. Sit. Blade approaches, uneasy. Miracia deals out the playing cards on a rickety table, setting them in nine piles which take on a cross formation. MIRACIA Perhaps you have brought me something -- an offering for the orishas? 75. Blade tosses a handful of bills on the table. Miracia nods, then flips over the first card in the center pile -- a one-eyed Jack. She sighs, grave --MIRACIA Hold out your hands. BLADE I didn\'t come here to get my palms read. I need something translated. Blade removes parchment fragment from his jacket and sets it on the table. Miracia traces her fingers over the ancient paper, touching her fingertips to her lips. MIRACIA Sangre. Written in blood. She runs her hands over each line as if it were written in Braille. Some of the candles gutter, then extinguish themselves as the wind around them rises. MIRACIA This is an old tongue, from an Q.J.s1 world. It concerns LaMagra. BLADE Who is LaMagra? The vampire God. His return. MIRACIA This speaks of Miracia\'s fingers search the parchment again. MIRACIA "-- there will come a Day Walker."

BLADE His blood -- ., The old woman nods, reaching for a smoldering cigarette. MIRACIA The Day Walker\'s blood is a disparador -- a trigger, you see? For LaMagra\'s return. One need only consume it and the spirit of his ancestors will settle upon him. ("reading") "And the Sleeper will rise from the shadows anew, cleansing the world in a Tide of Blood." BLADE (recalling the phrase) "The Blood Tide". MIRACIA (nodding) Yes. The vampire apocalypse. It is said that all who feel its taint will succumb to the Thirst. BLADE How do I stop it? Miracia shrugs, spreading her hands. MIRACIA The Great Wheel turns, . my friend. The Dark is rising. How would you fight a shadow? \xc2\xb7 Miracia sits back, slumping into her chair. The candles have burnt themselves down to nothing. MIRACI.?\\ I am tired. Dawn is coming. BLADE But I just got here --MIRACIA You\'ve been here longer than you think. Blade rises, looking to the horizon. Incredibly, dawn is comin9. As he stands there, mystified, the wind picks up, sweeping the parchment fragment out of his hand. 76. (CONTINUED) 88 'b"BLADE -Prod. Draft -9/19/96 88 CONTINUED: 3 He tries to snatch it back, but the fragment is quickly borne away. He watches it disappear into the sky, then turns back Miracia is gone. Blade glances around him, but she's nowhere to be found. CAMERA PULLS BACK, isolating Blade amidst the ghostly squalor. He raises a hand to shield his eyes from the morning sun. BLADE (to himself) Day Walker. The irony of his situation is not lost on him. 77. DISSOLVE TO: 89 INT. WHISTLER'S WORKSHOP -DAWN Blade steps out from the elevator into the workshop --The place has been trashed. touched dc\xc2\xb7m in. his absence. MACHs, caucious --It looks like a tornado has Blade pulls out one of his BLADE WHISTLER?! -- and then he stops dead in his tracks. WHISTLER has been strung up by his arms against the far wall, tortured and left for dead. In response to Blade's voice, a MOAN escapes the dying man's lips. Blade rushes to the wall, cutting Whistler down with his sword, gently lowering him into a chair. As he cradles the old man in his arms, Blade sees the primary wound --two ragged puncture marks along Whistler's throat. BLADE Jesus, Whistler, what did they do to you? Whistler opens his eyes, struggling to speak WHISTLER Frost took her --Whistler spasms and coughs, wincing from the pain. (CONTINUED) 88 89 "b"BLADE - Prod. Draft - 9/19/96 89 CONTINUED: BLADE Don't try to talk --WHISTLER Listen. You have to finish me off. You don't want me coming back. BLADE No, we can treat the wounds But Whistler is shaking his hand. WHISTLER Too far gone, you know that. Blade's at a complete loss. BLADE Whistler, I can't. Whistler clutches at Blade's arm, his eyes burning with conviction. WHISTLER Yes you can. Now get on with it. As much as he'd like to deny it, Blade knows that Whistler is right. He pulls a stake- \xc2\xb7from his bandoleer, hesitates. BLADE Whistler, I --WHISTLER (cutting him off, more gentle now) I know. (forcing a smile) Just be quick about it, will you? Do it right. 78. Whistler grips Blade's hand, holding it tight -- an echo of the action Karen witnessed when Whistler was injecting Blade with the serum. Blade fights back tears. With a wretched moan, he turns his head and drives the stake into Whistler's chest. Whistler GASPS, continues to grip Blade's hand --Gradually, the light dies from Whistler's eyes. His grip slackens. The old man is gone. Blade turns away, catching sight of --A SHARP VIEW-CAMCORDER (CONTINUED) 89 "b'BLADE - Prod. Draft - 9/19/96 79. 89 CONTINUED: 2 resting nearby, labeled, "PLAY ME". Blade reaches for the camcorder, cues the tape Frost\'s face appears on the tiny built-in screen. FROST Hello, Blade. By the time you watch this, Whistler will no doubt be winging his way to Heaven, thanks to your capable hands. If it makes any difference to you, he put up quite a fight. Frost touches a deep gash which runs across his cheek. A FURNACE, FROST I\'ll make this as easy as possible for you, Blade. You can find us at the Edgewood Towers. We\'ll be waiting with baited breath. TIME CUT TO: Blade stands before the open flames, heating his sword in the fire. He withdraws it -- it\'s molten red. Blade turns now to the medical equipment Karen brought from the hospital. \xc2\xb7rn the midst.of it we SEE the canister labeled 11EDTA11\xa2 Blade douses the molten hot sword into the EDTA canister. The refrigerated liquid reacts with the heat, causing the sword to STEAM and HISS. When Blade withdraws the smoking sword, we SEE that the gleamin9 steel has changed colors, taking on a bluish tinge, Just like the EDTA it was iM1ersed in. Blade smiles to himself, satisfied. CUT TO: 90 INT. FROST\'S PENTHOUSE, INNER CHAMBER - DAY Sparse decor in a Nee-Japanese vein. Minimalist lighting. The walls are glass. Recirculating pumps send a constant stream of water cascading down them. Karen is escorted into the room by Mercury. She gestures to a chair at the end of a long table. Karen sits.

A cigarette appears in Frost's hand. In the blink of an eye, the cigarette is lit, burning. The movements are so quick we barely have time to register them. FROST I understand you've taken an interest in our race. KAREN I believe your condition can be treated. Whistler and I were working on a cure when --Frost crosses over to Karen, leaning in close. FROST What makes you think we want to be cured? Blood is only part of the equation. The hunt, the killing, that's what the Thirst is really _about. Frost runs a fingernail acr6ss her cheek. She flinches. MERCURY Deacon likes to play with his food before he eats it. Frost smiles. Karen tries to keep calm, hoping to reason with him. KAREN Look, your people can't keep livi~g like this. Sooner or later, the rest of the world's bound to find out about you FROST Now there I'd have to agree with you. A given location can only sustain so many predators.

As he speaks, we SEE BRIEF, VIOLENT FLASHES of what he\'s describing -- a vision of the vampire apocalypse: FROST The Blood Tide. 91 INT. TEMPLE OF NIGHT (THE VISION) We are in an underground chamber (one which will shortly be known to us as the Temple of Night). A TIDAL FLOW OF BLOOD surges fotvard, collecting into a whirling cyclone. And out of that swirling blood-mist --FROST ( 0. S . ) There\'s a force, you see -- a spirit that exists in our blood. Its name is LaMagra. It came once before, at the dawn of our race. I\'ve discovered a way to invoke it again. 92 EXT. BANK OF EREBUS - CITY STREET - NIGHT (THE VISION) Every door and window of the bank is BLOWN OUTWARD as a TORRENT OF BLOOD flows down the entry steps. A SERIES OF SHOTS as the Blood Tide expands, manifesting into an hemispherical "bow-wave" of BLOOD-RED ENERGY which mushrooms outward through the city streets like a manga nuke explosion. PEOPLE, cars -- anything in the flash-flood\'s path is swept up and carried away as the Biblical deluge ROARs\'onward. Finally, the Blood Tide subsides, leaving the city a dripping, crimson wasteland. THE PEOPLE FROST ( 0 . S . ) Anyone caught in the Tide\'s path will be turned, instantly.

FROST The answers were there all along, of course, waiting for someone with the patience to decipher them. My elders were foolish enough to dismiss them as wives tales. But I knew better. (beat) Imagine my surprise when Blade turned out to be the key which would set that force free. Frost settles back into his chair, smiling. FROST LaMagra isn't a physical being. He's a spirit, requiring a flesh and blood host in order to manifest himself. KAREN (realizing) FROST Who better to usher in the Blood Tide? KAREN (shaking her head) Even if what you say is possible, there'd never be enough people to supply --FROST (finishing the thought for her) our thirst? Fortunately, I've found a way around that particular obstacle. 82. Frost pushes a button. With a HUM the ceiling above slides open, revealing something Karen wishes she'd never seen --LIVING BLOOD BANKS Sedated HUMANS hang above her, suspended by wires like nightmarish angels, hooked up to IV feeds which replenish various nutrients as their blood is drained from them. Shunts have been implanted in their forearms which serve as taps. (CONTINUED) 93 "b'BLADE - Prod.

KAREN Concentration camps. FROST If you like. KAREN You disgust me. FROST Why? Because we live at another species\' expense? Your people farm cattle and veal, don\'t they? Fattening them up with steroids? It\'s called evolution, Doctor. survival of tbe fittest. 8 3. Frost stares at Karen with an intense, uncompromising gaze. FROST It\'s time the human race heard a wake-up call. They\'re no longer at the top of the food chain. Just then, an alarm RINGS. A GUARD rushes into the room -\xc2\xadGUARD We\'ve got an intruder.

BLADE You should be. I've made some improvements. 85. Blade thrusts his EDTA-enhanced sword through the vampire's chest. Immediately, the vam~ire begins to boil from the inside out, as if he were being microwaved.

HELL\'S KITCHEN - NIGHT The street is empty save for the garbage that waits for collection. Rotten haystacks of moldered meat, soiled diapers, and sour milk crowd the sidewalks and stoops. A HISS OF STEAM bursts from a sewer grate. It RISES UP like a spirit, skirting the face of a crumbling Catholic church as the sound of wind WHISTLES through CREAKING rafters. An oily rat SKITTERS along a rain gutter matted with dry leaves. Each noise is exaggerated, amplified into a symphony of sounds. DRIP. DRIP. DRIP. DROPS OF BLOOD trickle down a stained glass window; cutting a clear trail across the dusty pane. We trace the blood trail up to a large CRUCIFIX at the roof\'s peak. DRIP. DRIP. DRIP. DRIP.

The agonizing process of learning to read all over again. Jack sighs--it's been too long. He turns from the bag just as Matt SLAMS the book shut. They face each other. A BEAT. Then Matt picks up the book. And Jack goes back to the bag. Two fighters on the comeback trail. CUT TO: EXT. STREET - DAY Matt is using his cane in a 'three-point tap and drag.'

Matt does a cartwheel and the CAMERA ROLLS with him, taking us on a dizzying, vertiginous ride as Matt goes faster and faster before flipping onto TWO HEATING PIPES. He SWINGS over them like a gymnast on parallel bars before dismounting atop a brick smokestack. Matt smiles into the night as we hear the sound of a CROWD CHEERING him on. CUT TO: EXT.

Matt traces the sound and effortlessly scoops them up on his way to the jury. MATT (CONT'D) (passing them out) These are photographs of the victim taken at Mercy Hospital that night. (back to Quesada) I wonder, Mr. Quesada, did she ask you for the cuts and bruises as well? Quesada smiles, lecherous. QUESADA Trust me. She loved every minute of it.

FOGGY Look, we knew it was a risk going in--MATT Why? Because she's from the Kitchen and not the Upper East Side? FOGGY Because she had a drug problem. Juries don't like their victims to be flawed. They judged her past and not her case. MATT How is she supposed to sleep at night knowing that they're out there? They stop and look out to the city together. FOGGY (sighs) You wanna get drunk?

He suddenly SWAN DIVES off of a ledge and PLUMMETS TEN STORIES to the street below. He smiles as he falls. The accident took his sight. But it took his fear as well.

But what some may mistake for obesity is actually grotesquely over-developed muscle. At Fisk's side (always at his side) sits his diminutive assistant, WESLEY, while TWO BODYGUARDS stand watch at the door. Urich watches as Fisk's huge hands gracefully work a pair of chopsticks over a giant plate of sushi. ( CONTINUED) ) "b"r CONTINUED: URICH I've been trying to get an interview for over a year, Mr. Fisk. Why now? FISK I'm well aware of the value of publicity. Even from a paper such as yours. URICH Or maybe one of your companies is going public--say your spice business--and you want some spin before it does? Fisk smiles. He's good. FISK Of course, I can't confirm that or I'd be violating federal trade law. URICH Of course. It's a long way from the old neighborhood. Isn't it, Mr. Fisk? FISK You can take the boy out of the Bronx, but you can never take the Bronx out of the boy. My net worth may now be north of ten billion dollars, but I still believe that a little dirt on a man's hands is a sign of success. URICH Let's talk about the dirt. Fisk chuckles. URICH (CONT'D) Have you ever heard of the Kingpin? Fisk's smile fades slightly. FISK Of course. My father used to tell me stories about the Kingpin when I was a child. How one man ruled all of the crime in New York City. Preposterous. Wesley nods, echoing his words: ftpreposterous.\xa2 URICH Maybe. Or maybe not. 23. ( CONTINUED) "b'CONTINUED: ( 2) FISK Of course, you\'re the one who writes about the Devil of Hell\'s Kitchen. What is it that you call him again? URICH \'Daredevil. \' FISK \'Daredevil.\' I wonder why the New York Times hasn\'t picked up on it yet? URICH Maybe they don\'t like being scooped. FISK Yes, I\'m sure that\'s it. 24. Fisk smiles condescendingly as Urich returns to his notes. URICH .I understand that you\'ve been buying up the harbor through several different holding companies. FISK You obviously have me mistaken for Nikolas Natchios, the shipping tycoon. (grins) Now there\'s a powerful man. URICH I have a source that says Natchios is only a soldier for the Kingpin. FISK Your very own \'Deep Throat.\' How exciting for you, Mr. Urich. You\'ll have to let me know how it ends up. URICH I will. Fisk extends a bowl of fish. FISK Now try the kimchi, it\'s to die for. Wesley mouths the words: "to-die-for." CUT TO: -~ 'b"25. EXT. RESTAURANT -DAY Fisk steps into his stretch limousine with Wesley and the two Bodyguards in tow. Urich lights up another Camel as he watches them drive off, shrouded behind tinted windows. CUT TO: INT. LIMOUSINE - SAME Where the two massive Bodyguards sit facing Fisk and Wesley in the back of the limousine. FISK Someone's been talking. WESLEY That's impossible. The only ones who know anything are Natchios and us. FISK This source of Urich's would have to be either very foolish or very weak. And Natchios is neither. Fisk runs his fingers over the heavy crystal end of his cane. FISK (CONT'D) You know, Wesley, in ancient times you'd cut your bodyguard's tongue off his first day on the job ... Fisk suddenly BRAINS Bodyguard #l with his cane! BLOOD SPLATTERS across the tinted windows as Wesley SCREAMS. Bodyguard #2 reacts. But not quick enough. Fisk CLUTCHES his windpipe with one massive paw and SNAPS his neck in two. And then it's over. Two men dead. In a matter of seconds. FISK (CONT ID) Handkerchief. Wesley hands a handkerchief to Fisk who calmly wipes off the crystal setting on his cane. FISK (CONT'D) Now, when does our friend Natchios get back into town? Wesley can't take his eyes off of the corpses. ( CONTINUED) "b"CONTINUED: WESLEY Tomorrow. Noon. Fisk glances at his reflection in the window. FISK If the press wants a Kingpin, I'll give them a Kingpin. on a silver platter. He lights a Cuban cigar. FISK (CONT'D) Get me Bullseye. 26. SMASH CUT TO: EXT.

Amongst the CACOPHONY OF NOISE we single out a MAN sitting close to the track. He wears a long, blue leather coat and his head is shorn clean like a bullet. CAMERA SLOWLY SWINGS AROUND HIM to reveal the TATTOO on the back of his head. A BULL'S-EYE. TRACK ANNOUNCER (CONT'D) It's Gimme Some Sugar and Excelsior \xa2.. Giimne Some Sugar and Excelsior rounding the corner with King Kirby in third \xa2.. VO:ICE Bang! Bang! Bullseye turns to see a LITTLE BOY sitting beside him.

And as she sets it down Bullseye reaches over and "accidentallya knocks it off the table. The wine glass SHATTERS as red Cabernet bleeds across the white cement floor. WAITRESS Oh dear. I\'ll be right back to clean that up for you ... And as she turns to leave Bullseye holds up the STEM OF THE BROKEN WINE GLASS; it\'s jagged end is as sharp as a knife. He looks over to the Boy and holds his finger to his lips. BULLSEYE Shhh ... TRACK ANNOUNCER (V. 0. ) Its Gimme Some Sugar by a length! Gimme Some Sugar heading for the stretch! Bullseye suddenly spins and WHIPS the glass stem ou~ into the track piercing the neck of the lead Jockey! The Jockey falls to the track where he\'s TRAMPLED by the other horses!

BULLSEYE Looks like your lucky day. He winks and "shoots\xa2 back at the Little Boy with his finger as his PAGER goes off. He checks the message before turning and disappearing into the crowd.

Matt knows what\'s coming and tries to change the subject. MATT Great. Could you pass the sugar? Foggy unscrews the lid on the SALT SHAKER and slides it over. FOGGY Actually, it\' not great. He paid us in fluke. That\'s a fish, Matt. Did you know that? Because I sure didn\'t. MATT He goes fishing on weekends. FOGGY And I go salsa dancing. But you don\'t see me offering to dance for my bills. MATT And a grateful city thanks you. Matt pours the salt into his coffee. FOGGY We can\'t keep taking these pro bono cases. We need better clients. Foggy squirts ketchup into the creamer. MATT Define "better." FOGGY Guilty rich people. Cream?

MATT Behind you. Foggy looks over his shoulder to see ... ELEKTRA NATCHIOS. 30. An exotic beauty with a wild mane of black hair. Her body is equal parts muscle and sensuality. And although she's dressed casually (low-slung hip-buggers, baby doll t-shirt, belly ring) she still has the aura of privilege about her. MATT (CONT' 0) Tell me. FOGGY You want the truth? MATT And nothing but. FOGGY She's hideous. Matt grins. He knows Foggy' s lying, of course. Foggy picks up a spoon and uses it to check his reflection. And as he does Matt deftly switches their coffee cups. FOGGY (cont'd) As your attorney in this matter I must advise against any further action. Foggy puts the spoon down to see--Matt's already gone.

MATT Wait. I didn't get your name. She glances back. ELEKTRA That's because I didn't give it. She walks out of the coffee shop as Foggy hoots: FOGGY DE-NIED! Matt smiles ruefully.

ELEKTRA How did you do that? MATT Ancient Chinese secret. ( CONTINUED) "b"CONTINUED: She offers a little smile and deflects his guard before lashing out with an iron claw. Matt cross-blocks it. MATT (CONT'D) That's a shao-lin technique. ELEKTRA So is this. She backs him up with a succession of STRIKES AND LUNGES. Her style is graceful and deadly; ballet meets Kung Fu. MATT (sensing) You're holding back ... ELEKTRA Yes. Don't. 34. She ups the attack. They circle each other as a HOMELESS MAN stops to watch this bizarre show. ELEKTRA What are you? A sensei? MATT Nope . A lawyer. HOMELESS MAN Kick his ass! Elektra laughs and doubles-up her attack. The fight is \xc2\xb7growing more intense--but also more playful. Sexual even. They sense each other's every move--like fighting a mirror. MATT All this just to get your name? ELEKTRA Try asking for my number.

A LONG BEAT. There's so much he wants to say. But in the end \xa2\xa2\xa2 what can he say? He gives a sad smile. She nods back.

ROXANNE I didn\'t want you to think I was still pining for you after all these years. It\'s too pathetic. Johnny smiles as the sunset bathes them in a golden glow.

NEW ANGLE Ghost Rider turns to face Officer Ploog as --CRACK! -\xc2\xadthe policeman smashes him across the face with his baton! CLOSE UP -GHOST RIDER As he looks back to reveal his jaw's come unhinged. He resets it with a BONY CRACK as Ploog runs for his car! IN THE SQUAD CAR The policeman starts the engine and locks the doors. "b"THE GHOST RIDER clenches his skeletal fingers as we go \xa2\xa2\xa2 INSIDE THE POLICE CAR'S ENGINE A series of MACRO SHOTS as we move amongst the pistons, cylinders, and intake manifolds. The vaporized fuel begins to ignite --but then the miniature explosion contracts and implodes upon itself before we go \xa2\xa2\xa2 BACK OUTSIDE 52. To reveal the car won't start. Somehow, the Ghost Rider has extinguished the flames with the police car's engine! OFFICER PLOOG Get away from me! NEW ANGLE A white-hot HEAT HAZE generates from the Ghost Rider's fists as he SLICES through the squad car door like a human oxyacetylene torch, chopping the vehicle apart! ON THE POLICEMAN cowering as the Ghost Rider peels back the roof of the car like tin foil and lifts the officer out by his neck. GHOST RIDER LOOK INTO MY EYES. Ghost Rider pulls him close, forcing him to stare into -\xc2\xadTHE GHOST RIDER'S EYES. Hungry black sockets that suck the fire from the air. The Officer tries to scream as he stares into those awful pits as we see IMAGES from his past spark to life before us: FLASH! We SEE Officer Ploog planting .evidence. FLASH l we SEE Officer Ploog beating a witness. FLASH J we SEE Officer P loog shooting an unarmed man., The images come fast and furious, rapid-fire mini-movies of every horrible thing he's ever done in his miserable life. OFFICER PLOOG W-What? ffhat are you doing? "b'53. A BLUE FLASH flares within the Ghost Rider\'s eyes as we see the SAME IMAGES repeat themselves --but with one big difference. This time Officer Ploog is the victim! GHOST RIDER YOUR SOUL IS STAINED BY THE BLOOD OF THE INNOCENT. FEEL THEIR PAIN. Ploog tries to scream but the air is gone from his lungs. GHOST RIDER (CONT\'D) A HUNDRED FOLD. Every act of violence, every evil he\'s ever committed, is revisited back upon him. This is the PENANCE STARE. And compared to this, death would be a welcome relief. OFFICER PLOOG falls to the ground, shuddering and glassy-eyed; his brain on eternal overload as he relives his sins forevermore \xa2\xa2\xa2 THE GHOST RIDER WAVES HIS FIST as his motorcycle races to his side.

And then CAMERA CRANES UP over the hill to reveal why \xa2\xa2 " THE SUN. It rises over the horizon, casting a crimson flush over the green valley. At last we know Ghost Rider\'s Achilles heel. GHOST RIDER stumbles off of the motorcycle and crawls along the ground. The flickering Hellfire coursing over his skull snuffs out as Johnny\'s body begins regenerating from the inside out. First the muscles and ligaments, then the inner coriwn, and finally the epidermal layer. Johnny trembles, desperately reaching for something, before finally touching a tree. WIDER -to reveal it\'s the old OAK TREE on Crowley Hillo Still visible in the trunk of the tree are the words: Always & Forever The memory BURNS from his touch. And then a SHOVEL is thrust in the earth beside him as Johnny looks up to see CARETAKER. The mysterious old man from the cemetery. CARETAKER Nice goin\', bonehead. He spits a stream of tobacco juice as Johnny passes out. FADE OUT. FADE IN: INT.

JOHNNY'S POV -as his blurry world focuses to revea.l the craggy, scowling face of Caretaker staring down at us. JOHNNY ABB! "b"ON JOHNNY as he scoots back from the old man \xa2\xa2\xa2 CARETAKER Don't thank me all at once. 56. Johnny looks around to see that he's laying on the back porch of a shack with the sprawling graveyard before him. JOHNNY Why am I in a graveyard \xa2\xa2\xa2 ? Caretaker spits a stream of tobacco juice. CARETAKER First come. First served. Johnny just stares. CARETAKER That was a joke, kid. JOHNNY Right \xa2\xa2\xa2 Johnny starts to get up but grimaces with pain. He may have been invincible last night as the Ghost Rider, but this morning as Johnny Blaze he's feeling it. Big ti.me. JOHNNY What happened to me last night? I feel like I got hit by a truck. Caretaker chuckles. JOHNNY Did I say something funny? CARETAKER Ironic. We're big on irony here. Caretaker pours a cup of sludgy black coffee. CARETAKER (cont'd) What's the last thing that you remember from last night? Johnny shakes his head .. But then he winces as: JOHNNY Roxanne \xa2\xa2\xa2 "b"57. And the thought of abandoning her again hurts worse than any of his injuries ever could. CARETAKER A girl. Typical. Caretaker hands him the cup of coffee. CARETAKER What about after that? JOHNNY All I can remember \xa2\xa2\xa2 is rage. Johnny sips the coffee as his stomach lurches \xa2\xa2\xa2 CARETARER You're still just a host body for the Spirit of Vengeance. But pretty soon you'll start to get control over it. And with control comes the memories \xa2\xa2\xa2 (beat) Whether you want \xa2em or not. We CLOSE ON Johnny's reaction \xa2\xa2\xa2 EXT. SAN VENGANZA -DAY A SCORPION scurries across the barren dessert floor with the forgotten ghost town of San Venganza in the b.g. It suddenly stops and raises its tail, sensing a predator, before a HAND suddenly shoots up out of the ground and YANKS it beneath the surface! INT. UNDERGROUND CAVERNS -SAME Gressil tears into the scorpion as if it were lobster meat before scuttling down into a labyrinthine MAZE OF CAVERNS. Here, hidden from the deadly sunlight, massive crystal stalactites make for an eerie, othe:cworldly terrain. WALLOW (O.S.) The Rider is strong. WIDER -to reveal The Hidden have set up camp here. We see a disturbance in the CHANNEL OF WATER that flows through the caverns before Wallow rises up from beneath the surface. SK:tNNER (O.S.) He's not that strong \xa2\xa2\xa2 "b"58. We PAN OVER to reveal Skinner glowering, his leathery skin still scorched and swollen from the Ghost Rider's chain. GRESSIL (smirking) So that's sunburn then? Skinner's sharp bones punch out of his skin as he growls: SKINNER I'll separate the .meat :from your bones, you bottom :feeder \xa2\xa2\xa2 BLACKBEART (O.S.) That's enough. They turn to see Blackheart in the mouth of the cave. BLACKBEART (cont'd) Wallow is right. This Rider is different from those in the past. He has a reason to fight \xa2\xa2\xa2 SKINNER The Spirit of Vengeance has always been constant. It doesn't change. BLACKHEART No. But the host body does. The Adversary has claimed his soul. But someone else has claimed his heart. Blackheart steps over to the soul Crystal that sits atop a majestic stalactite shrine and gazes into its eyes. BLACKHEART we must find who holds his heart -\xc2\xadand then cut the reason out. Skinner smiles as he sharpens his cleavers \xa2\xa2\xa2 EXT. CARETAKER'S SHACK -DAY Where Caretaker is disinfecting Johnny's shoulder wound. His calloused hands move deftly. He's done this before. JOHNNY Why me? CARETAKER The Spirit is a Rider. A Road Wraith. And you're the greatest Rider there is. "b"JOHNNY I'm not the right guy for this. I don't even have any faith \xa2\xa2\xa2 CARETAKER So get some. It doesn't have to be in God. Faith can come from anywhere. Caretaker holds up a needle. CARETAKER (cont'd) Sterilize this for me \xa2 . Johnny just looks at him. CARETAKER (cont'd) Go on. 59. Johnny tentatively reaches out and touches the needle as a spark of BLUE FLAME burns across the steel. Johnny shakes his head. Then he winces as Caretaker starts stitching \xa2\xa2\xa2 CARETAKER The thing you fought last night was an Elemental Demon. An aerial one by the looks of these talon marks. JOHNNY Elemental \xa2\xa2\xa2 ? CARETAKER (nodding) They call themselves The Hidden. And they've existed in this world long before the advent of man. JOHNNY You're telling me that these things can be anywhere? Any time? CARETAKER Not anytime. They're nocturnal, like you. During the day your body is your own. But once the sun sets you' re on demon duty. Get near 'em and you're gonna pop like a tick. Johnny suddenly stops as: JOHNNY I remember something \xa2\xa2\xa2 He takes a deep breath \xa2\xa2\xa2 tortured by the memory \xa2\xa2\xa2 -------------------"b"\\,.__../ JOHNNY There was a policeman \xa2\xa2\xa2 a dirty cop \xa2\xa2\xa2 I could see all the terrible things he's ever done \xa2\xa2\xa2 and then I turned them against him. Big time. CARETAKER The Penance Stare. It sears the souls of the wicked. Pray you're never on the receiving end. JOHNNY So why didn't I use it against the Hidden last night? CARETAKER Because \xa2\xa2\xa2 demons don't have souls. Johnny shakes his head. This can't be happening. JOHNNY I keep thinking \xa2\xa2\xa2 that any moment I'll wake up and this will be over \xa2\xa2\xa2 CARETAKER If you ever do, do me a favor \xa2\xa2\xa2 (finishes the stitch) \xa2\xa2\xa2 and wake me, too. JOHNNY How do you know about all this? Why are you helping me, anyway? CARETAKER Let's just say that I'm payin' for some mistakes of my own \xa2\xa2\xa2 and leave it at that \xa2 . Caretaker starts to wash up as Johnny gets to his feet. CARETAKER (CONT'D) You should get some rest \xa2\xa2\xa2 Johnny grabs his leather jacket. JOHNNY I can rest when I'm dead. He stops when he sees it's riddled with BULLET HOLES. JOHNNY (CONT'D) Which, from the looks of th1ngs, should be some time tonight \xa2\xa2\xa2 60. "b"61. EXT.

As the TRAM GLIDES toward its destination, the Guardians are overwhelmed by transcendentally splendid surroundings. The plant life is colorful and alien.

PALACE - MOMENTS LATEREgo SAUNTERS with Quill, Gamora, Drax, and Mantis, through the enormous open doors, toward huge DIORAMAS lining either side of the palace, like cosmic Stations of the Cross. EGOThis form you see before you is only an extension of who I truly am. I dont know where I came from, exactly.The DIORAMAS around them begin to ANIMATE: In the first, a FLICKERING BRAIN COMPOSED OF POLYCHROMATIC LIGHT FLOATS in space. EGO (CONTD)The first thing I remember is flickering, adrift in the cosmos - utterly and entirely alone .The flickering brain pulls cosmic dust and rocks into itself, ingesting them, GROWING.  50\xc2 Marvel 'b'EGO (CONTD)I fed on the matter around me like plankton. I grew smarter and stronger.   A hard metal shell forms around the brain, with channels running through for his energy to flow like rivers .  EGO (CONTD)I formed a sheathe to protect myself from the elements.Ego continues developing outward from the shell, growing the planet, then its beautiful landscapes and structures.EGO (CONTD)And continued building from there, layer by layer, the very planet you walk on now. I built the spires reaching up to the sky and the tunnels burrowing into its depths.QUILLWow.EGOBut I was no ant to be fulfilled solely by labor. I wanted more. I desired... meaning.In the core shell - the Self Chamber - the flickering brain floats, alone, perhaps sad.EGO (CONTD)There must be some life out there in the universe besides just me , I thought, and I set myself to task with finding it. The brain grows a SKELETAL FRAMEWORK OF LIGHT up from the self chamber and to the surface of the planet.  He pulls molecules around this shape to create his human self.  EGO (CONTD)I created what I imagined biological life might be like, down to the most minute detail.DRAXDid you make a penis?QUILLDude. 51\xc2 Marvel 'b'DRAXIf hes a planet, how did he make a baby with your mother? He would smush her.QUILLI dont need to hear about how my parents, you know -DRAXWhy? My father would tell me the story of impregnating my mother every winter solstice. QUILLThats disgusting.DRAXIt was beautiful. You earthers have hang-ups.EGOYes, Drax, Ive got a penis. QUILLOh my God.EGOIts not half bad. Ive also got pain receptors, a digestive system, and all the accompanying junk. I wanted to experience what it truly meant to be human as I set out amongst the stars. In another DIORAMA, Ego explores various uninhabited and barren planets.  EGO (CONTD)I visited thousands of planets over thousands of years, one barren husk after the next until I found what I sought... Ego stares down at a CUTE ALIEN CHILD.EGO (CONTD)Life. I was not alone in this universe after all.Ego reminisces: wistful? Sad? Its hard to tell. QUILLWhen did you meet my mother? 52\xc2 Marvel 'b'EGONot long after. Ego turns toward the last set of DIORAMAS. They show Meredith and Ego kissing and Ego with his hand on Merediths pregnant belly. EGO (CONTD)It was with Meredith that I experienced love for the first time. I called her my river lily. And from that love, Peter, you. In the final DIORAMA we PUSH IN on the belly and see, inside the womb, VERY young Peter Quill, a fetus, himself encased in light. Quill looks up in amazement - this story is the story of himself. And Ego gazes at Quill with adoration.  EGO (CONTD)I searched for you for so long. When I heard a man from earth held an Infinity Stone in his hand without dying, I knew you must be the son of the woman I loved.Ego puts his hand on Quill.

The label morphs to different flavors. EXT. A VACANT LOT -- NIGHTColored light from the billboard flickers over a bullet riddled sign: ROUTE 85. U.S. BORDER, EL PASO, TEXAS. Beneath the sign is a LONG BLACK LIMOUSINE. Cars whip past on the highway. Then A VAN passes, blasting some future version of Techno Latino Hip Hop. A SQUEAL OF TIRES OS. Now the music gets louder as the van returns, cruising slowly past the black limo before pulling into the lot. Five Bangers bail out and check out the black stretch. The limo doors are locked, windows tinted, so they cant see whats inside, but they check out the tires and wheels and like what they see. With the speed of a pit crew, they open the back of the van and out come TOOLS AND A JACK. INT. LIMO -- SAME We move over the back bench, past empty bottles, fast food  wrappers as A SLEEPING MANS FACE ratchets into frame. He opens his red eyes. The man is LOGAN aka The Wolverine or more accurately, Drunk Wolverine. He blinks, dazed, feeling the car lurching upward. Older than we've seen him, he clutches a Tequila bottle. EXT. LIMO -- EL PASO HIGHWAY TURNOUT - NIGHT As the back door opens, the tequila bottle drops to the dirt and A BOOTED LEG STEPS OUT. Logan shuffles, stiff, to the other side of the stretch where the Bangers work, removing wheels, lit by colored light. LOGAN...Uh. Please stop, guys. Those,.. those are chrome plated lugs.

Basically, if youre on the make for a hyper choreographed, gravity defying, city-block destroying, CG fuckathon, this aint your movie. In this flick, people will get hurt or killed when shit falls on them. They will get just as hurt or just as killed if they get hit with something big and heavy like, say, a car. Should anyone in our story have the misfortune to fall off a roof or out a window, they wont bounce. They will die. As for our hero with his so-called eternal life and healing. Well, hes older now. If you keep reading, youll discover Logans about to get his ass kicked. But before we get to that, we should make it clear his abilities aint what they were. Yes, hes a drunk, but hes also fading on the inside. Adamantium implants leeching into his system, causing chronic pain and diminished healing, hence booze as painkiller. So by all means, go ahead and worry about him. Now where were we? Oh, yeah--As the smoke settles, a CROWBAR-toting Banger angrily chews out Jitters in Spanish for firing. The others resume their work... none aware of Logan slowly getting up, till --  LOGAN (CONTD)Guys... seriously...(gets to his feet)You dont wanna do this. The Bangers react to Logan with bafflement. Ad-lib Spanish reactions, nervous chuckles --CROWBAR presses down JITTERS gun as he moves to Logan.We hear a familiar SNIKT! as claws slowly extend from one of Logans hands, then mostly extend from the other. Logan is still frowning at his bad hand  when-- CROWBAR THWACKS HIS SKULL. A metallic ring.Off balance and pissed, Logan swings at them as they converge, but hes drunk and soon they are pounding him with knives and guns and fists and a torque wrench. Final Shooting - 8/23/2016 2.'b'He tries his best to keep them from the limo, catches one guys bat an inch before it would dent the car.  Another one of them shoots in that direction, but Logan puts himself in front of the bullet. The pain from that little move stops him long enough for them to resume the pummeling. Suddenly, Logans eyes go yellow, pupils dilating. He lets out a long, loud yell. Fury rockets up in him, like cocaine.HE STANDS AND RAMS HIS CLAWS INTO CROWBAR and kicks another Banger into the back of the open van. Yet another runs at Logan only to get gored in the neck and tossed. This is real work for Logan, not easy. And it is fueled by rage. Jitters again raises his sawed-off, he will nail the car for sure, but Logan slices off his arm above the elbow. Sadly for Logan, the hand, while disconnected from the body it once belonged to, is still holding the gun. So, as it hits the dirt, the gun goes off, putting several pellet-sized holes in the door of the limo. This, more than anything else, doubles Logan anger--LOGAN (CONTD)Motherf--WHO GETS HIT ONCE MORE --and then goes after the last banger who, seeing he had his chance, leaps into the van and spins out of the lot, his wounded compadre in back, spilling onto the dirt as the van bounces back onto the road. Logan picks up his keys, some loose change and a single silver bullet. He stands, staring at the holes in his otherwise pristine stretch as RAIN BEGINS TO FALL. He sucks in deep breaths, forcing himself to regain control. His eyes return to normalcy. A PHONE VIBRATES OS. Logan takes out his, looks at it (hes got a fare), kicks the jack from the under the chassis. WE CRANE UP as Logan starts up the stretch and makes a loop in the lot, taking care to run over the three remaining Bangers before laying rubber onto the highway...

This wave dispatched, LAURA FLEES, HIDES BEHIND THE CATWALK SUPPORTS. The armed Federales hunt for her among the supports and she starts picking them off, one by one, with her blades and even with their own guns. Suddenly, Laura is pinned against a concrete wall by A MUSCLE BOUND REAVER.

Logan punches a button, opening the sunroof as gunfire starts to hit their limo.Laura leaps into the limo. Charles smiles at her, pleased and seemingly oblivious to the gunfire: CHARLES (CONTD)Laura! As they take a hard turn, a side window shatters and LAURA INSTINCTIVELY SHIELDS CHARLES FROM THE BULLETS.

She reaches the hypodermic, attempts to hand it to -- Logan who falls to his knees from the shrieking wave. He fumbles, almost dropping it, eyes starting to roll up in his own head as he lunges and jams the needle into Charles neck. After a moment, RINGING stops -- Logan falls back-- the remaining Reavers fall to the ground and, as they gasp for air, Laura and Logan kill them all. Brutal.

Inside the big box strapped in back, there is some sort banging, then a low guttural screaming.Now, the Red Haired Man, carrying a medical case, approaches the flatbed and opens the back hatch, disappearing the big box.

His voice seductive, smooth.RED-HAIRED MAN (CONT'D)These hybrid bees were stronger and aggressive to be sure, but despite their fortitude, they made no honey at all, nor assist in pollination.

Then she sees--THE ROCK AND EARTH BENEATH THE CONTROL VAN START TO HEAVE UPWARD and LIFT THE CONTROL VAN into the air...Rictor screams as the power of his mutancy ripples through him and with one last push --  He releases the rocks beneath the van--AND THE HUGE VEHICLE TOPPLES ONTO X24, CRUSHING HIM. Meanwhile, the children stare at Pierce. He lies dead at their feet, mummified in ice, blood and twisted grass.Logan gets to his feet and reaches out for Laura. LAURALaura. You need to get out. (to the other children)All of you. Get out of here! Now!Suddenly, the is a metallic CREAK AND KLUNK AND X24 EMERGES, BLOODIED, FROM BENEATH THE TOPPLED VAN. The children scream as the monster makes a run at them. LOGAN(to the children) Go, go  GO! Run!The children comply, Laura most hesitant as -- Logan stumbles to position himself between the children and the unstoppable fully healed creature charging at him --X-24 GORES LOGAN WITH BOTH HIS CLAWS and, using them like grappling hooks, drags Logan off to the forest's edge. LAURANo!Final Shooting - 8/23/2016 123."b"X24 heaves Logan onto a fallen stump, A JAGGED WOOD LIMB SPEARING THROUGH LOGAN'S TORSO. Logan howls in pain.Laura runs to the pistol in the grass. Pulls the Adamantium bullet from her pocket, fumbling to load the gun as--Delirious, losing blood, LOGAN grabs helplessly at X24s claws (already plunged into him) as the monster jams them deeper, through him, and into the log-- then raises them for one last goring when --X24s Adamantium skull suddenly explodes. He collapses to the ground. Done. Laura stands ten feet away, holding the smoking pistol. Her eyes meet Logan's and she drops the gun and runs to him. LOGAN AND LAURAShe hacks Logan from the tree stump. Logan slides painfully to the forest floor. He struggles to breathe. His body is decimated, his skeleton showing through his wounds.Laura's eyes are wild and fearful. She can see he is mortally wounded... She kneels.LAURAno, no, no...LOGAN...Take your friends and run. Go. Listen to me, Laura. Run. They'll just keep coming and coming. (grips her)...Dont be what they made you.The other mutant children emerge from the woods. Stand quietly at a distance.Logan watches them all, his eyes glassy, his body still. Laura takes Logans bloody hand, and this time, he holds on. LOGAN (CONT'D)...its okay...LAURANo... ...daddy...Logan looks at her. Then stiffens. Takes a short breath... And in his eyes, there is a flicker of wonder.LOGANSo this is what it feels like. Final Shooting - 8/23/2016 124."b"And then his breath releases and he is very still. Laura squeezes his limp hand. Disbelieving that he has passed. But there is nothing left in him. Still holding his hand, Laura looks up at her friends, tears in her eyes. The other children gather closer. WIDER ON -- ALL THE CHILDREN IN A CIRCLE AROUND LOGAN. They just stand there in the blast-radius of the carnage as the sun drifts lower in the sky. LAURA (O.S.)A man has to be what he is, Joey. You can't break the mould. EXT. MOUNTAINS - LATE DAYThe young mutants lower Logan into the ground. BOBBY has made a simple wooden cross for Logans grave. Laura stares unrelenting at Logan as the dirt covers him. LAURAThere's no living with a killing. There's no going back. Right or wrong, it's a brand. A brand that sticks. Now run on home to your mother, and tell her everything's alright. There's no more guns in the valley...The children all look to Rictor. RICTORWe gotta go.The children all grab their backpacks and start on the mountain trail to Canada. But Laura hesitates, still looking at Logan's grave. She does not move, but then, tearful, grabs her own backpack. As she passes Logan's makeshift cross, she looks at it a moment, considering, then kneels and tips it on its side to make ---- an X. The camera moves in on the X as in the distance, Laura joins her friends scaling the dark mountains, moving toward their future.

It reads ID CONFIRMED: PARKER, PETER.HARRYI guess you're who you seem to be.PETERPlease just tell me you didn't put a camera in the bathroom.Harry taps, and all the barriers retract; the beams die.

Wearing a long black Gaultier jacket. Smiling like a manwith a surprise in store for us. He and Czernowitz meet. A stiffness between them. Czernowitz looks intimidated.OTTOFrank.CZERNOWITZOtto.They shake hands awkwardly. Then Otto strides to the podium. Grins, self mocking. Behind him on a table, a violin andbow. Piano to one side."b'11.(CONT\'D)(CONT\'D)(CONT\'D)OTTOHe told you I was "dazzling," but what he\'s too nice to bring up is was what an insufferable little wretch I was.Laughter. The lights dim; spot on Otto. Behind him a large flatpanel monitor descends. As he talks, the display will mirror, expand on and illustrate his words.OTTOBiomimetics seeks to adapt for human use the technologies of other species. We poor humans have always envied our fellow creatures their talents; soon we will share them. Peter is rapt; Harry is playing Tetris on his Palm Pilot.OTTOMy own researches have been into arachnid technology: adapting, the remarkable abilities of spiders, their web-spinning abilities, their astonishing, almost precognitive impulse control.Harry notices how spellbound Peter is; leans over.HARRYI will never understand this spider thing of yours.Peter takes no notice.OTTOWe had some success with manipulating spider RNA. But it\'s in the area of octopedal locomotion that things are really getting exciting. The goal is to provide stable motion on every possible kind of terrain and superior manipulation at a distance.Otto steps out from behind the podium.OTTOYou can\'t imagine the sheer number crunching might required to control and coordinate eight legs. Really tough. Actually, it was a chance visit to the Bronx Zoo that gave me the key insight.'b"12.(CONT'D)(CONT'D)(CONT'D)(CONT'D)(CONT'D)He walks toward the monitor, which displays an octopus, along with a diagram of its nervous system.OTTOThe octopus has the equivalent of a powerful processor in each leg, networked to the central unit in her brain.The display fades to a diagram of the Rig, eight legs networked to each other through and to the center.

But we've been able to implement a similar system using...Otto takes a step forward, smiling a little coyly. Then from somewhere behind him a pair of glinting pseudopods snake out. The black stealth-bomber glint of superhard ceramic. A gasp from the audience.OTTOFour!Harry sits up. Puts away the Palm Pilot. The 'pods hover over Otto's shoulders a moment, undulant.OTTOI call it a self-articulating network, but I'm afraid the name that has stuck is Otto's Octopus.One 'pod reaches to tap him on the shoulder.OTTOYes? Oh, thank you. It is a little warm in here.The arms help him out of the jacket, and as it comes off, another pair of pseudopods is revealed. The audience goes a little nuts.One 'pod takes up the violin; another, the bow. The next pair snake out toward the piano; Otto strikes up a Grieg sonata. With his own two hands, he takes out a fat cigar and lights it; puffs contentedly.The audience, amazed, afraid, half suspecting that it's all a prank.

One at a time, inturn, he raises and lowers each foot.OTTOEach one of my four assistants here is equipped with its own hundred-teraflop processor.He begins to stride back and forth across the stage on his four dancing pseudopods.OTTOComputer architecture so sophisticated and capable of learning it approaches consciousness.He sinks back onto the two lower \'pods.

RIGHT UPPER produces a pen and scrawls something across the paper. Then the \'pod with the paper slaps itacross Otto\'s back. He turns around, as if confused, walking on the lower pseudopods. The sign says GEEK!Laughter from the audience. They\'re eating this up. Otto, back to the audience, whirls his head around.OTTOGiven time, and a strong enough host...(rueful smile)...its systems and my own would actually begin to integrate with each other--The pseudopods rip away his shirt, revealing THE RIG nestled right up against his spine, overlapping his own flesh.OTTO --Merge into one organism.'b"14.AUDIENCEShock, even revulsion at the sight of the implants.

The goal is a permanent interface. Of course the ideaof a permanent human/machine integration makes some people uneasy.Granted, MJ's looking a little uneasy. Otto fingers the Latch.OTTOThe Rig is designed to seek to implement a systems merger with the host. Unfortunately, so far, my flimsy human tissue's not up to the challenge. Not yet.

Looks at it.OTTOSo, maybe it's out of line. For me to ask you this. But I don't want to make a fool of myself. Are you seeing Peter Parker? Because if you are--MJNo. I was. But he wouldn't... He couldn't... He just couldn't.OTTOIt's really none of my business."b"50.(CONT'D)But he looks pleased with the information.

Yes, we were using a modified arbovirus. Highly infectious in spiders. We replaced the nucleonic RNA with whatever we wanted to code for and the virus did the rest.PETERIs this arbovirus infectious in humans?OTTOIt could be. If we had wanted to introduce spider material into a human, I suppose we could just have just gotten one of the little critters to bite--Staring at Peter.

Kind of a quiet guy.OTTOKnow if he was ever bitten by a spider?PETERHe might have been. I wouldn't know.OTTOWe lost a spider. If, by chance, it bit him. Is that what happened?

No way to control the process, I suppose, relying on a bite.(beat)He could probably use one of these eventually.He reaches into a tray behind him. Holds up a tiny ziplock bag with a speck inside. Peter leans in to look. A tiny bit of circuitry--a spider-mite of silicon.PETER What is it?OTTOIt's basically an immune system on a chip. You seed it with a sample of the material you want to defend against, and it pumps out antigens. I call it a parity chip.PETER Parity?OTTOEquilibrium.

SIREN getting louder.OTTO(normal voice)You're so lovely.The fingertip of the 'pod strokes her cheek with the same tenderness. Ick.MJGet away from me!She tries to duck free of the 'pod. He won't let go.SPIDER-MAN (O.S.) Let go of her.Otto turns. Sees Peter standing there. Laughs.OTTOWe're out of candy, kid. You'll have to TP the house.SPIDER-MAN Put her down!He flies at Otto. Otto sidesteps him and, reinforcing his grip on MJ, starts to flee up the side of a building. On top of the building they start to fight.A leaping pursuit across the rooftops. Elevated tracks inthe distance. On the next to last rooftop before the tracks, Otto turns. The fight begins.It's not a fair fight; Otto his hampered by holding MJ.Otto looks at MJ: reproach in his eyes. Then he sets her gently down. And leaps over to the next building."b'68.Spider-Man goes to MJ. She shakes his arm.MJGo get him. Please. He\'s not bad.Peter peers at her through the eyeholes of the ski mask.PETERDo you...Do you love him?MJHe\'s my friend. He\'s angry. And dangerous. Please, Spider-Man. Don\'t let him hurt himself.Spider-Man nods. And goes after Otto. Chases him across the last rooftop before the tracks. Otto hesitates on the ledge.Spider-Man flies at him headfirst. HITS and they both tumble over the side of the building."TRAIN SEQUENCE" (TR)They fall onto the elevated tracks that run alongside the building.A train is passing at that moment. They smash down onto the top of it and are carried along the rushing tracks.Otto rights himself. Gets to his feet.OTTOI\'m ready. Come on.Spidey rises and then it\'s basically a five mile long version of King of the Hill, at high speed. Or maybe the myth of Sisyphus. Otto digs at the head of the car, and Spidey comes after him. And Otto throws him off, and Spidey comes after him.Every time he falls off the train, something worse happens to Spider-Man than the time before. It\'s brutal. But he always climbs back on.At one point Spidey manages to get right onto Otto\'s back. He gets his hand in at the root of the \'pods and grabs hold of the Latch. Pulls on it. It SNAPS and swings free. Still attached. But useless. And Otto HURLS him off the train. Spidey climbs back on.After the Latch busts, Otto just keeps getting stronger. But we notice that Spidey seems to be tiring. He\'s winded.So it makes Otto angry that Spidey keeps on coming. He knocks Spidey off again, and then smashes in the window of the car beneath his feet, reaches in with his \'pods.'b"69.He starts yanking people right out and tossing them to the side. Spider-Man snares them all in webs. The last time, his webbing SPUTTERS before it fires.Finally Otto rips the controls right out of the car. Then he jumps off the train. Spider-Man wants to go after him.But the train is now hurtling out of control. He can't just leave it.He stays. And it's a good thing, because a big L-bend in the tracks is coming up. And the train is going much too fast to take the turn.Spider-Man manages to get all the passengers evacuated to the rear half of the train.Then he gets behind the first three cars (now empty), rightin down between, and cuts the lead ones loose. Gives them a mighty push. They race ahead, smash through the guard rail, and PLUNGE over the side of the elevated.Now Spider-Man has to stop the part with the PASSENGERS. He jumps down in front of the car that's now the lead. Plantshis legs against the speeding track itself. Railroad ties SNAP-SNAP-SNAP and the momentum slows. But not enough.Finally, web SPUTTERING, at the very limit of his strength, Spider-Man strings his own body between buildings with webbing, making himself into the focus of a giant slingshot, with all those tons of train shoving right up against him.And the train slows. And slows. And slows. And stops. The Passengers CHEER.Utterly spent, his makeshift costume tattered, gaping holesin his mask, Spider-Man hangs over the abyss, clinging to the edge, held in place by the tension of his webbing against the bulk of the train behind him. And then--AT HIS WRISTSThe webbing gives out. For good. The spinnerets FOAM OVER like emptied aerosol cans.He hangs suspended for a moment. Then falls--And is caught, by the Passengers. Leaning out of the front windows of the train.They drag him back in and lay him on the floor. His mask is so torn and stretched that you can see more than half his face.The passengers look down at him. Then AN OLDER MAN reaches down and tugs the mask back over Spider'man's face. Looks upat the others: Anybody got a problem with my doing that?"b"70.(CONT'D)Nobody does.INT. ANANSI PROJECT LABORATORY - NIGHTOtto stumbles back into the lab. He's crying.

We hear an AMBULANCE' s SIREN in the BG. Ba takes an interest, moves across the street. As he walks, his brow furrows, two and two coming together in his mind in a bad way. Be walks faster. And faster. Be elbows his way through the back of the swelling crowd. Then\xc2\xb7 the middle.

A silver strand of web fluid shoots out across the street. Spider-Man wraps his hands around it and leaps. We leap with him, swinging out over the city, held aloft by the tensile strength of the web. We plummet down, in a graceful, terrifying arc, and as the ground races up toward us, Spider-Man's left hand rises -- !l'BNIP! Another web strand .rockets out into the\xc2\xb7night, the web-slinger shifts his weight to the second strand, abandoning the first, pulling himself back up in a graceful arc that leads him out into the avenue. 46 Well, abon the avenue anyway, he's now swinging along directly above the chase, which is below him. ~\xc2\xb7 19 DONN ON TSE STREE'l', Uncle Ben's Oldsmobile SCBEECBES around a corner and SMASHES through a row of newspaper boxes.

Be rotates, lands softly on his feet behind the Carjacker. The Carjacker whirls around, BLASTS a shot at Spider-Man. Sensing it, Spidey leaps, onto the nearest wall.

The blow lifts the man right off his feet, knocks his stocking cap off, and sends him sailing\xc2\xb7into one of the unbroken windows, which SHATTERS.

Dust dances about, making it difficult to see. Be looks up, hears the WBOOSBING of the Goblin\'s Glider circling about. Ba gets to his feet, staggers and falls down. Pulls himself back up. Ba looks at himself, covered in blood, costume in shreds. Ba hears a strange blood curdling scrapping noise. Ba looks around, spots the lone unbroken window in the structure covered by a wooden shutter \xa2 Ba approaches the window, still punch-drunk and flings back the shutter. A horde of razor bats press against the window, flapping their wings against the glass. Suddenly they burst through, sanding shards of glass raining clown on Spider-Man. They encircle him, diva, SLICE and SLASB at the few parts of his body that remain unbloodied. Be screams out, tries to swat at tham but that only leaves massive gashes in hi.a hands. Spider-Man looks across at the wall on the far end of the room and races toward it. The sw&J:m of razor bats follow. Be runs full spaad at the wall, jumps, plants his feet on the wall and does a back flip. The razor bats fly under him, crash into the wall, crumple to the ground. Spider-Man looks at the heap of razor bats on the ground. A cocky smi.les creeps across hi.a face. SPmER-MJUf You ain\'t so bad. Bis happiness soon fades as more bats come after him.

Be looks up at The Goblin hovering over him, tries to stand. Bis lags turn to jelly and ha crashes to the ground. The Goblin laughs, reaches down onto his glider and pulls out a rod. Be presses a button and three blades pop out giving the weapon a pitchfork/spear appearance. GREEN GOBLIN (CON'I'' D) Ahhh, misery, misery, misery.

Be yanks the spear from The Goblin, SMJlSBES it against his head so hard it sends The Goblin flying back ten feet crashing to the ground. Spider-Man rises, pissed, full of adrenaline, furry. Be breaks the pitchfork over his knee, tosses the parts to the\xc2\xadside. Be grabs The Goblin by the chest, pulls him up from the ground, throws \xc2\xb7 a haymaker to The Goblin's jaw. The Goblin goes flying through a nearby wall. The Goblin rises, manages to advance. QACit ! Spider-Man deli vars another devastating blow. The Goblin crumples against a nearby stone wall.

In sudden real time, Peter hurls himself to the side, twisting and bending in a near-impossible contortion --the Glider's turbine SCREAMS as it whistles just past him -\xc2\xadterror creases Osborn's face and his or,n Glider rockets right through him. Noz:man Osborn slumps over, impaled by his own contraption, pinned to the wall. Peter rushes forward, but it's too late. So dies Spider-Man's \xc2\xb7first, and most heinous, archfoe.

He stares forward at nothing, gathering his will.  And now we see the GUN in his waistband.  His hand takes it and points it down and into the snow but he stares ahead.  His thumb PULLS THE HAMMER BACK and the heartbeat starts to race.  From behind and to the side a bit: THE DULL PULSE OF A GREENISH GLOW IN THE BASE OF HIS SKULL, beneath the edge of his cap.

The BOTTLES FLOW BENEATH HIM ON THE CONVEYOR BELT.  The manager likes him, but cant figure him out. He smiles.MANAGER(Portuguese)I keep telling you...let me put you on payroll. I can pay you what youre worth!Banner looks up and smiles and shakes his head and in doing so he CUTS HIS HAND.C.U. - TWO DROPS OF BLOOD: fall toward the moving bottles.BANNER: seeing this...sudden intensity, tracking it\xa6 he MUST find where the blood went. Tracking the bottles he thinks were under him with his eyes...LOCKED on them.He jumps down and starts moving along with the belt, trying hard to track them, YELLING at his friend the manager to stop the belt\xa6 The belt stops.  BANNER MOVES ALONG IT SEARCHING. And he finds it:  a BLOOD SPOT on the conveyor belt.  RELIEF.  He wipes it off carefully.  Not noticing...ANOTHER BOTTLE, with drops of blood dripping just inside the glass lip, down into the soda. He signals Okay and the belt starts up again.BANNER:  taking out the CRAZY GLUE again.

BANNERS APARTMENT - EVENINGWe can see the details of his essential life, his work, the STRAY DOG he feeds.  Oblique details like rope tied to jam of kitchen window and coiled neatly on counter.  A Styrofoam head with a wig of dark hair and a baseball cap on it. We notice these things without emphasizing them.  A low bed in the corner against a wall.  Not much else. He's living like a monk.BANNER is entering, eager to get to work...He sits at his roughly fashioned WORKTABLE. On it seems to be his only possessions of note:  rows of various SMALL GLASS BOTTLES with liquid in them, neatly self-labeled and arranged in rows.  One DECENT LOOKING MICROSCOPE.  A SMALL FIELD SATELLITE LINK ANTENNA and a LAPTOP COMPUTER.  He turns on the SATELLITE LINK and the COMPUTER and starts to Instant Message:BANNERS SCREEN: (Banners writing in Green, his collaborators in Blue)Mr. Blue?(a pause)Mr. Green...hello.

Keep me posted.  And good luck :)And Banner begins to work:MONTAGE:  BANNER EXTRACTING A CHEMICAL FROM HIS FLOWERSOver many hours, Banner works.  Methodically and painstakingly extracting tiny amounts of juice from his precious flowers, mixing it carefully with chemicals from self-labeled bottles and mixing it all in an assortment of glasses doubling as homemade test tubes; cooking it down over a small gas flame. Referring to BLUEs NOTES on his computer.Finally, all seems ready...a final step.He PRICKS HIS OWN FINGER...so carefully placing ONE DROP of his BLOOD on a glass slide.  He slides it under the microscope and looks at it:C.U. - BANNERS BLOOD: red blood cells fringed with a subtle GLOWING GREEN ENERGY. Like residual radiation.He takes the slide back out. Takes a breath.  This is it.6."b'In a dropper, he extracts some of the PURPLISH LIQUID he has been slowly refining from the very small amount in the glass.  Carefully he brings it over the blood sample... and squeezes ONE, TWO THREE drops onto the blood.He places the slide under the SCOPE and looks again:C.U. - BLOOD:  The Purple liquid seems to be literally boiling away around the cells.  Frying.  No change. The GREEN TINGE is still there.BANNER pulls back from the scope and puts his forehead against the heel of his hands.  He had let himself hope and now he is devastated.BANNERS SCREEN:Green: No mitigation.Blue: None?  Your tissue exposure must be relatively high.Green: Very high.Blue: Try a higher concentration.

Supply is limited.Blue: Not here. Were making pure synthetic by the gallon.(pause)Why are we doing this backwards? Chasing flowers in the jungle = silly.

Ill confess something to you if youll clear up some things for me...First, I confess, as a man...as Bettys lover... that I have always hoped you were dead. Not because I didnt like you but because I love Betty and Ive known that unless you were really gone, or she believed you were, that there would always be three of us in this relationship.  Ive dreaded the thought of you walking through the door. But now that youre here...I have to admit that Im very happy about it.  Because Im also a psychiatrist. And Im very committed to putting light into dark corners, so to speak, and Im very good at finding my way into the places people hide their secrets. I do it primarily because I think it helps them but also frankly because Im interested in what people have to hide. Betty has a very dark corner that I have never found my way into, despite considerable, careful effort. And the only thing I know about her dark place is that you are in it.  And Im wondering if youll be honest enough to tell me: why are you something that she wont talk about? This is said simply, directly...without threat or malice.BANNERThere are...aspects of my personality that I cant control. And I hurt Betty...in ways I will never forgive myself for. 52.SAMSON (CONT'D)"b'SAMSONYou dont drop your career and fall off the face of the earth for five years because youve got an anger management issue, Bruce.  You see a shrink.BANNERIts a little more complicated than that.Samson, Ive been alone for a long time now. I have to be. The toughest part of it is that I worry about what Ive done to Betty.  If shes happy and youre a part of that, then that makes me very happy. Honestly.  The last thing I want to do is cause any trouble for her...or for you. Id kill myself before Id hurt her again.SAMSONTotally honest and yet avoiding something. Exactly like her.INT.

Advance things a little.BANNERI think thats what we told ourselves. At least the General was honest about what he wanted out of it. I dont think we were as honest.BETTYNo, youve turned this on yourself too hard. We did talk about it and we were all comfortable.

A PRIMAL SCREAM takes us to: EXT. RAIN-SWEPT RICE PADDY - DAYNot the Japan you imagined.  We are in her dark ages,        in the midst of a savage tribal war.  WARRIORS are draped in primitive animal hides with a thick outer layer of finely woven grass to shed the pounding rain.  Faces are marked with war-paint.  Weapons are iron and combat in clumsy with the battlefield under two feet of water.  Casualties are high.VOICE (V.O.)There was no Emperor then.  No shogun, no Samurai.  Only rival warrior clans, fighting over food, land and religion... But two particular clans, their names lost to history, fought only for blood.  EXT. BAMBOO FOREST - CLEARING - DAYDIFFERENT CLANS. A different kind of battle. The dress is lighter - weapons sophisticated, fighting techniques refined. War-paint has given way to colored sashes. One side wears RED, the other BLACK. ON ONE SIDE OF THE CLEARING WE FIND: THE RED WARLORD, a polished volcanic stone around his neck, watching the merciless fight with cold, unblinking eyes.  VOICE (V.O.)It was a feud so old its reasons could not be remembered - so bitter its wounds could never be healed.  The only objective... revenge. ACROSS THE CLEARING: THE BLACK WARLORD, a strand of green pears around his neck, calmly looks on.  'b'EXT. RICE PADDY - DAYThe sky clear, the war over.  Peasants plant rice.

They could see only one path to peace...CLOSE ON: A GLOWING IRON ARROW is pulled from a flame and extended between the Warlords.  We cannot understand the Red Warlord, but we can see his tone is firmer now. Final. He extends a hand.  The Black Warlord considers, then offers his own hand.  VOICE (V.O.)

Lonely. Isolated. AN EAGLE drifts into frame, eyes sharp, head ticking left, right, center, left again - then diving. We follow and emerge from the clouds TO REVEAL: A brilliant green mountain valley one thousand feet below, snow-capped peaks on either side. We are one with the eagle, adrift on the wind, living only for the hunt. We fly lower, faster - skimming snow, rocks, evergreens, A MAN IN WELL-WORN LEATHER.  Blink.AND NOW WERE WITH THE MAN. But hes only a man for lack of a better word. He barely glances at the eagle flying past his head, the bird wondering how the Man came to be here. Much like the Man himself.  The Man squats, knuckles in the soil - primal - his thick black hair framing an unshaven face. He is un-phased by his proximity to a sheer, three hundred foot drop. He studies an animal track between his feet - wider than his two wide hands placed side-by-side - Five toes, long claws. The animal is a giant.  He stands slowly, holding up a shred of brightly- colored nylon clotted with blood and hair...  The Man hears something we cant, smells something we dont, follows his keen senses toward his quarry. We notice he is strangely equipped for a remote mountain trek. Boots, jeans, a leather jacket. No pack, no heavy weather gear. No weapons that we can see...The sound of hard, steady wind takes us to: INT. CAVE - DAYLooking out from darkness to the cold gray light of day - wind howls past the mount of the cave like a siren, a warning. The Mans silhouette approaches...EXT. CAVE - DAY He looks into the blackness - buffeted by the wind, noting claw marks on the cold rocks. His sharp eyes adjust, making out the empty sockets of a cleanly peeled human skull. The wind suddenly stops, changes course. The Man sniffs, turns, too late. 6.'b'WHACK- He is struck across the face. He lands on his back across a sharp boulder, head bleeding. A mass of claws backed by a gaping mouth filled with  teeth descends. He rolls, screaming as his dislocated arm twists. The beast slams into the boulder, dislodging it from the gravel bed. Then we see the animal whole.  A GRIZZLY - fur matted and rank, muscle caked with blood, breathing strained, other-worldly. An arrow is lodged in the animals spine. The bear lunges with surprising speed, shoving the rock as it stands upright - eleven feet fall, howling. The rock slides toward the steep drop as: The Man scrambles to his feet, dazed - painfully wrenching his dislocated arm back into its socket, holding his partially detached scalp in place. The ground beneath him gives way and he tumbles down a steep gravel slope, sliding toward a thick fallen redwood bristling with sharp, broken branches. The large boulder tumbles after him...WHAM- The man hits the tree hard, inches from being impaled. The boulder skids down the slope behind him - SHHHHHHHHHHHWHAM - pinning his legs to the tree. He howls in pain, cries in vain to lift the tree. Then a new shower of stones behind him. The bear is coming. The Grizzly slides down the slope in a hail of rocks and debris right for the Mans back.  He tries to turn and face the attack, but the rock wont let him. With no other choice, The Man arches himself backward over the rock, wrenching his smashed legs, sucking up buckets of pain. The world upside down now, he extends his arms as if to embrace the bear. And then: SCHICK- Three gleaming, ten-inch blades extend from between the knuckles on both hands. In another universe, this would be inexplicable. In the world of Logan, of Wolverine, this is a day at the office.  He braces for the impact of 1000 pounds of screaming meat. Given the circumstances, he screams as well.WHITEA helicopter roars across the sky bearing the slightly dated rainbow striping of the very dated:ROYAL CANADIAN MOUNTED POLICE.  7.'b'EXT.

Id like a word with him. 2-6-2 out. He walks, his men follow - past the rock, past the tree; hacked in half as if by rabid beavers. Drag marks and hand prints in the dirt tell a story: A man with three blades in each hand pulled himself toward the nearby river. Then signs of these blades vanish. The drag marks stop and foot-prints appear, telling us this man managed to find his feet. The footprints lead into the river. The story ends.  YOUNG MOUNTIEWhats this about a hunter, Sarge?SQUARE JAWLast night a fella comes up to the North Barracks. On foot . No gear. No gun. Smoking a cigar, if you can imagine. Heard we had a rogue bear on our hands. Told the dispatcher it would take us weeks to find it. Said he could track it in a day. Dispatch asks him how he figures on finding a half-crazed man-eating bear in the high country all by himself. This character with the cigar says: Cuz I understand it.And now the Mounties wonder if something worse than a man-eating bear could be out there. EXT. WOODS - DAYLogan squats hidden by the trees, watching the Mounties across the river. He shivers, soaking wet, his wounds gone. He pulls a three inch long splinter from his hand, dropping it in a pile of several more. The gash it leaves heals before our very eyes.  He picks up an arrow with distinctly colored flights taken from the bears spine. The tip is a broad-head with a cruel hollow point, dripping amber liquid.  Logan turns the arrow over again and smells the flights. Then he stands and walks into the woods.  9.'b'EXT. ROAD HOUSE - DUSK Eighteen wheelers roar through cold rain under an angry gray sky. Logan crosses the highway toward a battered road house offering beer and bait in neon.  He wanders through the mud-clotted pick-up trucks parked out front, breathing deep and slow through his nose. He stops at a truck with deer antlers in the grill, a wolfs tail on the antenna. In back he spies a bow and a quiver of arrows, the flights familiar.  INT. ROAD HOUSE - NIGHTFrench Canadian country music - if you can imagine such a thing - in a smoky room filled with TRUCKERS, LOGGERS and HUNTERS - forty men al told. None small. On the muted TV we see the RCMP around a redwood cut clean in half, a rock and two white sheets. The scroll tells of five missing campers, a rogue bear and how the Mounties shot the animal dead.  Logan, dirty, wet, brooding, walks along the bar, breathing deep and slow through his nose. He pauses behind one man in particular.  A DEEP SWIGGING MEATY CANUCK in a greasy orange hunting cap. Logan drops the arrow on the bar in front of him. Pause.  MEATY CANUCKThats a poison broad-head, mister. Theyre illegal.LOGANAsk me where I found it.MEATY CANUCKDont care.LOGANIn a bear. Up the back country. Seems whatever fat slop shot that animal didnt have the wind or the skill to track it down proper and finish it off. The meaty Canuck glances up at the TV.LOGAN (CONTD)And instead of dropping a lethal dose, this arrow bled poison into that bear for days. Made him crazy. Killed five people. 10.'b'MEATY CANUCKThats unfortunate.LOGANThats murder. Five counts... for the man who shot that arrow.MEATY CANUCK(half turning, glaring)And you think thats my arrow?LOGANI knowit is. And Im gonna hear you tell it to the Mounties.  Logan puts a hand on the Canucks shoulder. The Canuck throws a punch - his hand full of beer-mug. CRUNCH- Logan staggers back, covering his face. The Canuck spins, ready to fight. He freezes. Confused.  Logans hand covers what must be a pretty bad wound. But when he wipes off the blood, theres only a small cut on his face. He rolls tongue n cheek and a piece of glass pops out. The Canuck watches it fall to the floor. When he looks back at Logan, the cut is gone.  LOGAN (CONTD)Let me show you how it works.WHAM- Logan drives his right fist into the Canucks gut. He doubles over into Logans left fist, held anvil-steady. The Canuck collapses, jaw broken.  LOGAN (CONTD)Now heal.(as the Canuck tries to crawl)Yeah, I guess you could read that two ways. What I meant was- WHACK - A pool cue hits Logan across the back of the head. He merely winces and turns.A BIG LOGGER, holding a broken cue like this is a joke on him. Logan sighs, calms himself. LOGAN (CONTD)Now I dont want any trouble. This is between me and him, not - EVERY MAN IN THE BAR stands.  LOGAN (CONTD)... All of you.11.'b'A BIGGER LOGGER steps up, holding up a baseball bat.  BIGGER LOGGERLets see you break thi-SCHLICK-SMACK - Logans claws flash through the bat. In the same motion, he punches - his claws retracting an instant before he connects with the Loggers jaw.  CRUNCH - And were off. Loggers, Truckers, and Hunters, fueled by liquid courage, rush him in waves. The fight is without grace, without choreography. A close-in 40-to-1 head-busting brawl. Then 30... 20. CLOSE ON: A MASSIVE LOGGER by the back door, wisely watching, waiting. Hes fondling an axe.  The last man falls. Logan is a bruised and swollen mess - his ability to heal taxed to its limit. He sees the Massive Logger coming, winding up his axe.  Logan staggers back, arms too spent for defense. But he wont surrender. He lunges with a howl. The Logger side-steps and sticks his foot out. Logan trips, dents the edge of the bar with his head and hits the floor face down. The Massive Logger places a foot on Logans back rests the axe on Logans neck.MASSIVE LOGGERSmaller chunks for thwood-chipper.He raises the axe and: VOICE (O.S.)DROP IT.ANGLE ON: Square Jaw and his Mounties in the doorway, guns drawn. BLACKNo sound. A bright flash. Sparks. We are looking down at a vaguely human form submerged in a tank of water - a liquid casket. Red-hot, molten metal pours from behind us into the water. An explosion of steam, images strobing like snapshots, a fast-moving flip-book of war and anguish, peppered with the presence of a woman, her face hidden by a shadow here, long hair there. Her back is to us, walking down a windswept beach. Then Logan is holding her in his arms, wailing in anguish at the sky, her body limp.  12.'b'Logan opens his eyes. He does not gasp or cry out. He simply... exhales, trembling slightly, subtly betraying his fear of sleep. He looks to his left.  40 battered and beaten Loggers, Truckers and Hunters are pressed against a wall of steel bars, staring at him in mute fascination. PULL BACK TO REVEAL: INT. JAIL CELL - NIGHTLogan is seated alone in a holding cell wearing leg irons, his wrists chained to his waist. The men from the bar are in the adjacent cell. Perhaps for Logans safety. Perhaps for their own.  The last of Logans injuries heal slowly but visibly. The Canadians stare in mute fascination.LOGANBoo.All 40 tough, hardened men flinch and step back. Logan smiles. A beat later and the cellblock door opens. Square Jaw enters, followed by THREE MOUNTIES WITH SHOTGUNS aimed at Logan through the bars.  SQUARE JAWYou have a visitor. A DIMINUTIVE ASIAN MAN with horn-rimmed glasses walks onto the cell block. He wears a black suit and carries a plain white envelope. He bows. This is: ZENMr. Logan, I presume. I am Zen. LOGANYou certainly appear to be. Should I know you?ZENNo. But I have been following you for some time. Your arrest enabled me to catch up to you at last. I have arranged for your release pending a few...formalities.  LOGANThats bully. What do I owe you.ZENI assure you, Mr. Logan. The gain is entirely yours. 13.'b'Zen steps forward, offering the envelope. The Mounties tense - Square Jaw grabs Zens arm.  SQUARE JAWJust... toss it to him.Zen sighs, flicks the envelope through the bars. It lands between Logans feet.  He bends but, of course, he cant reach it with his hands chained to his belt.  SCHICK - A single claw stabs the envelope before retracting and bringing it to Logan. The Mounties are stunned, the men in the other cell mutter in awe.  LOGGERYou see that? I toldyou. SQUARE JAWI thought you searched him.MOUNTIEWe stripsearched him. The envelope contains a sheet of thin parchment. Old paper from an old typewriter. As Logan reads: ZENI assure you, Sergeant, if Mr. Logan was a threat to you or your men, he would not be sitting here now. And you would not be standing.SQUARE JAWWho- What... the hell is he?ZENThat is precisely what Ive come here to help him learn.LOGAN(re: paper)Where did you get this?ZENFirst we must have an understand-LOGANWHERE?Logan lunges, claws extending, slashing chains like ribbons, Shotguns rack and aim. He chooses to stop. ZENI can help you, Mr. Logan. But first... you must help me. 14.'b'EXT. MOUNTIE BARRACKS - PARKING LOT - NIGHTLogan still reading that paper. We get to see it now: PROJECT: WOLVERINEFollowed by dense military jargon. Meanwhile, Zen and a mix of ASIAN and WESTERN SUITS shake hands with SQUARE JAW and some MOUNTIE BRASS. Things seem to have been worked out.  They disburse. Zen walks over to Logan. He produces a cigar which Logan accepts. As Zen lights it for him: ZEN Your hunter confessed. The police admit they might never have found him on their own. They are very grateful. Logan looks past Zen to the Mountie Brass, looking this way with suspicion and disdain.ZEN (CONTD)Begrudgingly so, I admit. But they have dropped all charges. With  the understanding that you leave Canada and never return. Logan nods, stung, but used to it. Waving the paper: LOGANIs there more?ZENAll there is to know. Who you are. Where you come from. What was done to you and why. But I can only tell you what little my master permitted me to read. The rest is in Japan.LOGANJapa-Did you say your master? ZENHe is in Tokyo. A plane is waiting to take us to him now.LOGAN(laughing/turning to leave)Listen. Its been great. Thanks for bailing me out. Maybe Ill seeyaround.15.'b'ZENWe had an agreement.  LOGANYou had an agreementZENThey will arrest you if you stay in Canada. That stops Logan in his tracks.ZEN (CONTD)And you will have to comply. Or kill to maintain your so-called freedom. You will continue searching in the wrong place for answers to the wrong questions - wasting your gifts on petty acts of justice. A vigilante, living out your days like that bear - a hunted rogue. Like that hunter - an ignorant criminal. And you will neverfind an end to your pain.  LOGAN(turning back/glaring)What do you know about pain?ZENI stand in the presence of Historys Warriors. Witness to centuries of combat, ages of suffering - pursued by enemies he cannot name, grieving for a love he cannot remember. You are the living Prometheus. Compared to you...Ive never even felt pain. Logans face tells us Zen is pretty close.ZEN (CONTD)But I know the answers you seek are not here. And while your body heals quickly, your mind never will. Not until you recover your memories and confront them. Only then will you find peace. A peace I can give you.LOGANAnd what do I have to do for you?ZENLet me take you to my master. 16.'b'LOGANIn Japan.ZENIn Japan. Logan sucks on his cigar, considering this with no small amount of suspicion, then he steals a glance at the glaring Mounties across the way. He shrugs.  LOGANFine. Take me to your leader.ZENMaster.LOGANWhatever.AN EXPLOSION OF SOUND, a stream of blue flame.EXT. SKIES OVER THE PACIFIC - DAWNAnd a sleek private jet streaks eastward, away from the rising sun over a dark and uncertain sea. EXT. TOKYO - NIGHTAnother explosion - this time one of unearthly color, blinding light. Our eyes adjust to a world of flashing neon and LED on buildings, billboards, even many of the vehicles themselves - this place is one giant, ever changing video screen.  The streets are packed with a steady flow of fast-moving foot traffic, seemingly immune to the overload of surrounding imagery. Everything shines. Everything is impossibly clean. And everything wants you.   Welcome to Tokyo.INT. LIMOUSINE - NIGHT ANGLE ON: THE REARVIEW MIRROR and a womans cat-like eyes, glancing at Logan from under a chauffeurs cap concealing close-cropped hair.  This is YUKIO- 26. More on her later...Logan and Zen ride in back. As the mind-blowing light of the city rolls slowly past, the TOWERING FACE OF KINDLY OLD MAN becomes ubiquitous. God-like. 17.'b'Whoever he is, he is part of the current media cycle. Keener eyes will note a faint scar on his cheek.ZENYashida-Sama. My master.LOGANHes big in Japan. His smile fades, realizing the joke is lost on Zen. ZENYashidas family line is as long as the Emperors. He has given awaymore than Japans richest man has earned. His corporation has revolutionized medical research, agriculture, education. His wisdom has shaped our government..The master is Japan.  LOGANWhen do I meet him?ZENYou will see him tomorrow. First, you must. INT. PALATIAL HOTEL SUITE - NIGHTZen and TWO BREATHTAKING HOSTESSES escort Logan into a magnificent, penthouse suite overlooking all of Tokyo - room after room appointed in a careful mix of elegant tradition and ultra modern. In a city where space is precious, it is paradise.  Yukiostands in the hallway, her back to us, looking sharp and in a black two-piece suit.  The 100 inch TV is on, no sound - so hi-def it makes reality look grainy. Old Man Yashida is still on the news. A restrospective montage; photos with world leaders going back to JFK.Also humanitarian efforts - water, medicine, food for the Third World. The scroll is in Japanese, thus impossible to read.  Logan ignores this, scanning the surroundings, moving to the mini (actually quite maxi) bar and choosing one of ten different kinds of whiskey.LOGANThisll do.  18.'b'ZENI live close by and am at your service day and night. Zen hands him a business card. Logan shoves it in his pocket. Zen stares.  LOGANWhat?ZENIt is customary to read the card...LOGANNice...font.ZENIf there is nothing else you require...Zen subtly gestures to the Hostesses. They bow and smile. Theyd like to stay.  LOGANGnight.An impressed Zen and the clearly disappointed Hostesses bow deeply, backing out of the room.  CLOSE ON: Yukio in the hallway, stealing a glance at Logan as the door closes. For the first time we see her face and realize YUKIOIS MORE WESTERN THAN ASIAN.  Perhaps hardly Asian at all.  Logan closes the door, bolts it, chains it. He takes off his jacket, ours himself a shot, stars at the view. Then he notices a low table in the center of the room and he sole object resting on it:  A SAMURAI SWORD - very old by the looks. He admires the weapon, picking it up carefully, exposing the razor-sharp blade. He merely touches it and his fingertip bleeds then instantly heals of course. He notices a chain of Japanese characters engraved in the steel. One of them appears to have age-old dried blood in the grooves. His face suddenly changes. FLASHAND THE SOUND OF GUNFIRE TAKES US TO:19.'b'EXT. JUNGLE - DAYLogans repressed memory. Somewhere in the Pacific of WWII, amidst A HANDFUL OF RETREATING CANADIAN SOLDIERS engaged in a running gun-battle, vastly outnumbered by the pursuing JAPANESE. We find: Logan, machine-gun in hand, WOUNDED SOLDIER over his shoulder. While Logan runs and reloads, the Wounded Soldier shoots and vice versa. Until: A grenade blasts Logan off his feet. He leads in a heap, his partner dead. The dense foliage around him shreds in a hail of bullets. The last of his squad now, Logan runs as far and as fast as he can until:  CRASH - The ground under his feet vanishes and he plummets, landing with a sickening crunch. CLOSE ON: Logans face twisted in a silent howl of unimaginable pain. PULL BACK TO REVEAL: He has fallen face down into a man-trap filled with dozens of bamboo spears, impaled like an insect, spikes through his out-stretched limbs, his abdomen, his shoulder. He is completely immobilized - unable to free himself. His claws extend unconsciously and we notice they are raw bone - not metal. Useless.  He can hear the enemy in the distance, searching. He struggles to pull himself free, adding to his pain.  Then a SHADOW looms over him; A YOUNG JAPANESE SOLDIER - handsome, with dark, piercing eyes - rifle in hand. After inspecting Logans predicament, the Soldier drops his rifle and draws a sword. He rests the edge of the sharp blade on the back of Logans neck, nicking the flesh slightly. He raises the blade high. Logan braces for the end...CLOSE ON: The cut on Logans neck healing:  CLOSE ON: The Soldiers eyes widening. The Soldier lowers the blade, cuts Logans cheek and watches it heal. A drop of blood runs from Logans cheek onto the engraved steel - unmistakably the same blade he will hold in a Tokyo hotel room 70 years hence. The Soldier raises the sword and strikes.  WHACK- he hacks the bamboo pinning Logans right arm. Then he drops the sword in the pit. Confused but grateful, Logan grabs the blade as:  20.'b'The Soldier walks a few yards from the pit, listening with a mixture of fear and fascination to the sound of Logan painstakingly cutting himself free. The Soldier slowly draws a secondary short sword from his belt... waiting to face this unique enemy. Then: Logan leaps cat-like out of the pit, sword in hand, pulling the last piece of bamboo from his shoulder, the rest of his wounds already healed.  The Soldier shouts in Japanese, demonstrating with his short sword how Logan should defend himself.Uncertain, Logan raises his sword and.CLANK/CLANG/SMACK - The Soldier charges, hits Logans blade, slaps him with the flat side of his sword and is back in place before Logan can blink. We cant understand his words, but the Soldiers attitude says it plain: No, no. No. Do it like this. CLANK/CLANG/SMACK - He does it again, smiling this time. Now Logan is mad. He raises the sword, ready.  CLANK/CLANG/SMACK - Logan blocks the last strike, simultaneously extending his bony claws - tearing the Young Soldiers cheek. The soldier staggers back, stunned, watching as Logans claws retract, swallowed by the rapidly healing skin around his knuckles.  THE SOUND OF GUNFIRE turns their heads. In the distance, JAPANESE SOLDIERS are the ones running now, chased by A WAVE OF BRITISH SOLDIERS.  The Soldier knows hes doomed. He drops to his knees bows his head and waits for Logan to finish him. But Logan offers the sword handle-first. The Soldier is surprised yet again by Logan. He takes the sword as he stands. Logan nods to him: Go. That way. But the Soldier is torn. Ready to fight impossible odds.  Logan puts a hand on his shoulder - his eyes desperate for the boy. Go.The Soldier nods and runs to fight another day.INT. PALATIAL HOTEL SUITE - DAYLOGANThehellizzah-Logan wakes from a deep sleep on the sofa, rain beating the windows. The sword is back in its stand.  21.'b'The door opens behind him. He inhales. LOGAN (CONTD)Good morning, Zen. ZENI trust that you slept well.  Logan sits up, sees the Old Man on the TV again, looking at him differently now. LOGANIve met your master before, havent I? Zen steals a glance at the sword and nods. ZENYour encounter left a deep impression. He spent a considerable portion of his wealth to discover all he could about you. LOGANWhat does he want with me? Why now?The question seems to strike a nerve with Zen.ZENI will take you to him.Logan stands and a small object drops from the collar of his shirt, bouncing three times on the table before plunking softly on the carpet. EXTREME CLOSE UP ON: An iridescent, gray-green pearl.  Zen picks it up with his thumb and forefinger.LOGANWhat is that?ZENIt isnt yours?Logan shakes his head. No. Zens blood runs cold. ZEN (CONTD)Did you leave your room last night?LOGANNever left the couch. Can we go now? Id like to meet the old man. 22.'b'Logan heads for the door, opens it, waits.ZENMr. Logan... Unless you have another explanation as to how this came to be in this-LOGANThe last lady who stayed here lost an earring. Lets go.ZENOr someone placed it on your person while you slept.LOGAN(scoffing)Myperson? Without waking me? Me? Who would do that. Who even could?We suspect Zen might know the answer to that. For whatever reason, hes not sure to answer. Then: ZEN... Mr. Logan.LOGANZen... Enough with the oyster droppings. Take me to your leader.  Zen sighs, walks through the door.ZENMaster.LOGANWhat you said.Logan walks out, shutting the door. We remain focusing on the chain. We distinctly recall Logan putting it on. We dont remember him taking it off.  INT. LIMOUSINE - DAYLogan and Zen in back, the mysterious Yukiodriving, a dreary rain spattering the windshield.  EXT. TOKYO STREET - DAYLogan and Zen emerge from the limo into a crowd of SOMBER JAPANESE MEN AND WOMEN and black umbrellas.  23.'b'As the only Westerner (wearing denim and leather, no less) Logans presence is off-putting. But the too-polite attendees steal glances rather than stare. ANGLE ON: THE LIMO across the street.  Yukios comely eyes follow Logan until she is distracted by: An argument at the front door between THE DOORMAN and A YOUNG MAN trying to push his way inside. The crowd tries their best to pretend he is not there. Logan stares. The kid is a dead ringer for the Young Soldier he fought in the jungle.  The Doorman shoves the Young Man down in the gutter, humiliated. He gets up and storms off in a rage. This is KENUICHIO. Remember him. INT. AUDITORIUM - DAYPeople remove coats to reveal MEN IN DARK SUITS, WOMEN IN TRADITIONAL JAPANESE GARB. Logan finds himself in a room filled with rows of seats facing a stage draped in red velvet. He is on a receiving line at some high occasion for a very select group. The crowd parts behind Logan and Zen. People bow deeply to A PORTLY, BESPECTACLED, MIDDLE-AGED MAN and his TEAM OF BODYGUARDS.  He is accompanied by his CAUCASIAN SECRETARY - attractive, business suit - long, raven-black hair hiding one side of her face and glasses that subtly stir fantasies of the naughty school-marm variety.  ZEN(whispering)Bow, I said... Bow. Logan doesnt. The Portly Man gives him the once over as he passes. Logan does it right back, then winks at the Secretary. She blanks him. Zen is mortified.  ZEN (CONTD)That man is Noburo Mori. Minister of Justice.LOGANGood for him.Noburobarges to the front of the line and bows to the only soul here more impressive than himself: 24.'b'A STANTLEY MAN in his 50s - his bald head gleaming, his pale gray suit almost pearlescent. He is: ZENLord Shingen. My masters son. We will pay our respects.  On that stage, Logan spies a porcelain urn and a portrait of the Old Man with a black sash across it. Logan notes the staunch expression on the men, a woman quietly sobbing, and it hits him.  LOGANYour master is dead?ZENI never said he wasnt.LOGANYou coulda said he was.ZENI have followed my masters instructions explicitly. If there was a deception, it was his intention... not mine.LOGANIf hes dad, what the hell am I doing here? Shingen bows to Noburo , stepping aside to REVEAL:A YOUNG WOMAN. The woman. A beauty cut from marble. The sort you cant touch - but have to touch - and will never, ever get close enough to touch.  This is MARIKO.The very sight of her hits Logan like lightning. Noburo and Mariko exchange a formal greeting. Mariko bows, missing the slightly leering look Noburo gives her. But Shingen catches him. There is a tense dynamic at play here that will reveal itself in time.(Note: Take a moment. Look over the faces on the previous few pages. Youve met everyone who matters. )As Zen and Logan move closer to the head of the line: ZENI am instructed to tell you one last thing.  25.'b'Logan snaps out of his Mariko-induced trance. LOGANLast thing?ZENYou are free to leave at any time. But the knowledge you seek will only be yours when you honor the gift you have been given.  LOGANHonor the- What does that even mean-But he is cut off when they come face-to-face with Shingen. Zen leans in, speaks softly in Japanese. As he does, Shingens eyes shift suddenly to Logan. To the mute of shock of everyone, Shingen bows deeply, showing great respect. This leaves Logan eye-to-eye with Mariko. What follows is one of those subtle yet unmistakable moments between two people instantly, mutually attracted - both unsure of what to do.  Shingen straightens, obscuring Mariko and shaking Logans hand.ZENMr. Logan. Lord Shingen. SHINGENI understand you knew my father. LOGANIn a manner of speaking. Im... very sorry for your loss. SHINGENHe was a great man. He will be missed.(pushing away his grief)Excuse my poor manners. My daughter, Mariko. Shingen steps aside. Mariko bows gracefully - polite but not submissive. As Logan stares at her: SHINGEN (CONTD)Youll forgive me for saying so, but my father never once spoke about you. When you were mentioned so reverently in his will we were obviously intrigued. How did you come to know him?26.'b'Logan hesitates. SHINGEN (CONTD)It is an awkward question? LOGANAn awkward answer. SHINGEN(smiling warmly)My father and his mysteries. Perhaps after the ceremony you will be my guest at my home. There you can share as much or as little as you like. I promise not to pry. Logan glances at Zen. Zen nods: Say yes.LOGANI would be honored.SHINGENThe honor is mine. I hope you will excuse me until then.Logan nods, steps aside with one last look to Mariko. As Zen and Logan walk toward the back of the line:  LOGANWhat can you tell me about Mariko?ZENShe is to be married in three days.Beat. Logan is stunned.LOGAN...Married.ZENTo Noburo. Logan turns to look at the portly, high-and-mighty Minister of Justice.LOGANThatguy? Shes marrying that guy? ZENThe marriage was arranged by her father. It will be a merging of two great houses. A powerful dynasty. 27.'b'LOGANWhat does she have to say about it? ZENShe has a duty to her family. She will honor her fathers wishes. LOGAN(reassessing Shingen)And I was just starting to like the guy.Just then, A MAN WITH A PITTED FACE reaches the head of the receiving line. Shingen does not recognize him but remains cordial. Pit-Face bows deeply - a bit mocking. Then he lashes out with a tanto knife.Shingen is surprisingly fast, deflecting the blade, taking a slash to his forearm instead of his throat. A WOMAN IN THE CROWD SCREAMS, igniting chaos as: Logan leaps, reacting on pure instinct as:Shingen drives his good hand into Pit-Faces throat, crushing his windpipe as: SEVEN MORE THUGS rise up from the crowd brandishing knives. They rush Shingen. BYSTANDERS PANIC, getting in their way. Shingen calmly stands his ground, covering Mariko, as the FIRST THUG reaches him. As: Logan vaults over two rows of seats and crushes the First Thugs head under his heals, landing face-to-face with Shingen. The two men have an instant to make eye contact. They share a nod and turn to face the approach of six more knife-wielding thugs. But: SCHINCK - Logan has six blades of his own. MARIKOKuzuri.Logan glances at a stunned Mariko staring at his claws, fascinated? Terrified? Shingen looks at Logan with more than a few questions of his own.  They have to wait. The Thugs attack. Shingen and Logan meet them head-on. Despite the use of only one arm, Shingen holds his own, dodging slashing blades and striking one-handed. Shingen is a master, fighting with dignity and honor. 28.'b'Logan, on the other hand, kicks, slashes, brawls and cheats. Anything to win. Meanwhile: Noburos bodyguards draw weapons, but the cavalry is not coming. They whisk Noburo and his Secretary to the exit. Logan sees this, more annoyed than angry. CLOSE ON: Noburos secretary. She practically has to be dragged out, lingering to study Logan and his claws with fascination. Remember this.  AN EIGHTH THUG comes up behind Shingen. Zen leaps in the Thugs way despite having no weapon. The Thug sends him back with a single punch and then: MARIKO STEPS IN FRONT OF HIM. The Thug stops, thrown for a beat, unsure of how to handle her. Then he grins, changing his grip in the knife. Ready to kill. Slap -Mariko BELTS HIM ACROSS THE FACE, stunning him. She raises her chin, fearless. The Thugs grin is gone. He swings his blade: THUNK- Logan drives three claws clean through the Thugs forearm, punching him off with his other fist, turning to take on another attacker when: Yukio steps in his path, stopping him: YUKIOI have Shingen. Protect Mariko.(when Logan hesitates)GO. Yukio draws a knife and follows Shingen into the fray, breaking knees and kicking asses. Logan grabs Marikos hand, spies the exit and goes. To his surprise, this door flies open to REVEAL: ANOTHER THUG - aiming a gun and pulling the trigger. Logan leaps in front of Mariko and TOWARD the Gunman, slamming the door just as the gun goes off.BA-CLANKCLANKCLANK - the steel door sports three shiny bullet-induced dents in front of Logans face.  EXT. ALLEY - OTHER SIDE OF STEEL DOOR - DAYThe Gunman kicks the door, trying to open it. He bashes his shoulder into the door once, twice, backing up and rushing for a third when: 29.'b'Six razor-sharp adamantium claws rupture the door, pointing straight out. The Gunman cant stop. INT. AUDITORIUM - DAYCLOSE ON: Logan, knuckles pressed to the steel door. WHAM- something hits the other side of the door hard. Then silence. His claws retract and he opens the door, grabbing Mariko and stepping over what we assume is the Gunman lying out of frame.  EXT. ALLEY - DAYThe rain is pouring now. Up the alley, Logan sees the limos at the front of the building and SEVERAL POLICE CARS ARRIVING. He leads Mariko that way until:GUNFIRE. GUNMEN emerge from PARKED CARS and engage the police. The street is suddenly a wild-west show. Logan turns, pulling Mariko the other way when: SCHLING-SLICE - Logan recoils, the front of his shirt cut open, a slash down his chest healing in front of Marikos stunned eyes. Logan pushes her back as: A gleaming steel blade four feet long swings for his head. He ducks and rolls as the blade chops time and again, gashing concrete like it were clay. The blade hits a dumpster and wedges in the thick steel, giving Logan time to take in a chilling sight. A FIGURE IN GLEAMING ARMOR - derived from the ancient Japanese noble warriors, chest emblazoned with a red sun. He rips the blade from the dumpster and turns. His face is hidden by his gilded helmet - black shadows for eyes. His sword hums, raindrops sheeting off the crackling cushion of distorted air around it. Logan extends his claws and prepares to take his first piece out of SILVER SAMURAI. The Samurai is pretty sure it will go the other way. In one fluid motion he swings his charged sword, slicing the steel door and tearing a gash through the brick wall in an arch that ends at Logans neck.  CHING-The Samurai is surprised to see his sword stopped so decisively by six adamantium claws. Logan is just as surprised to see the Samurais blade doesnt break. Instead it throws off blue arches of energy between Logans claws, blistering his flesh. 30.'b'Logan screams and shoves the blade back, attacking. But the Samurai is fast, calm, almost prescient. Where Logan slashes, the blade is there to meet him. The few times he hits armor his claws encounter the same barrier of energy, raking across harmlessly. Samurai raises his blade. This is going to hurt.CLOSE ON: LOGANS RIGHT FIST. Two of his three claws retract. SCHUNK- Then an unholy scream of agony and rage. CLOSE ON: LOGANS RIGHT FIST, a single claw, driven neatly between two plates of armor in the Samurais side, the energized metal scalding Logans hand.The Samurai kicks Logan back, momentarily slowed by the wound to his side. Logan lands hard, pushing himself up, noticing his hands are planted on: A MAN-HOLE COVERHe considers his options, the vulnerable Mariko...SCHING-SLAM - Logan jams his claws into the man-hole cover and yanks it out, slinging the sixty-pound slab of steel. Samurai sees it coming, hacks it in half. One piece goes wide, but the other one hits him square in the forehead, knocking him flat.  Logan moves Mariko to the man-hole where a ladder leads down into darkness. She hesitates. But when Samurai sits up and finds his sword, she scrambles down the ladder. Logan turns as Samurai charges, blade high - ready to cut Logan in half. Logan calmly steps back and drops like a stone.INT. DRAIN-TUNNEL - DAYLogan lands in a torrent of knee-deep, rushing water. Mariko clings to the other side of the ladder, her heavy gown pulling her under. Logan expertly slashes, sending all but Marikos essentials downstream. Samurai looms over the man-hole above. His armor gives him too much bulk to come down. He hacks at the man-hole, making it larger. Logan takes Mariko by the arm, salutes Samurai, and lets go of the ladder. Together they are swept away. 31.'b'EXT. ALLEY - DAYSamurai  continues to carve up the pavement until A LONE COP at the end of the alley points and yells. Samurai sees him and freezes. The Lone Cop looks away long enough to call OTHER OFFICERS over. When he turns back, Samurai is gone. INT. DRAIN-TUNNEL - DAYLogan catches another ladder with one hand, holding Mariko with the other. They climb, emerging into:INT. BOILER ROOM - DAYA giant heating system hums. Logans claws pierce a man-hole cover and shove it aside. He climbs out, pulls Mariko up and then collapses, exhausted. Mariko kneels over him, his wounds miraculously washed away. Their eyes meet. Mariko kisses him - gentle but lingering - a little more than thank you. LOGANHave we met before? MARIKOI think I would have remembered. LOGANDont be too sure.(standing, sore)Should get you someplace safe. He heads for the door and opens it to: Sirens walking, POLICE EVERYWHERE. Chaos. He shuts the door quickly, looking around. MARIKOIm safe with you. She stares at him, her eyes hypnotic.LOGANIn case you hadnt noticed, lady, Im barely holding my own.(she keeps staring)And whatever kind of trouble youre in... Im worse. 32.'b'MARIKOYoure the trouble I choose.LOGANArent you getting married?MARIKOEventually. Logan looks toward a staircase on the far side of the room, leading up. He sighs. LOGANThis way, then...And he reads her up the stairs...EXT. AUDITORIUM - DAYChaos and confusion as the police cordon off the area. In the rain-soaked crowd we find Zen and Yukio escorting Shingen to an ambulance. SHINGEN(in Japanese)[Where is my daughter?]ZEN[Well find her, Sama. First we need to tend to that arm.]They reach the ambulance and Shingen steps in back. MEDICS swiftly slice off his jacket and shirt, revealing a surprisingly ripped frame for his age. LOW ANGLE LOOKING UP as Zen goes to shut the door: SHINGEN[Find Mariko, do you hear me? Nothing else matters.]ZEN[I will search high and low, Sama.] He is unaware that BEHIND HIM AND HIGH UP, Logan and Mariko make their getaway along the rooftop.Shingen slumps back into the ambulance. The medics go to work as Zen and Yukio shut the doors and stand guard. ACROSS THE STREET THEY SEE: Justice Minister Noburo talking to a MOB OF PRESS. 33.'b'NOBURO [... but my staff reacted swiftly and the would-be assassins were pacified. I credit the fine men of the Tokyo Police for putting down the second wave of the attack.]REPORTER[Witnesses say Lord Shingen was the target of the attack and not you. Do you have any idea why someone would want to kill Lord Shingen?]NOBURO[This brazen and cowardly act happened just days after I proposed a crackdown on organized crime-]REPORTER[Are you saying this is the work of the Yakuza?]NOBURO(stepping away)[I am saying this brazen and cowardly act happened just days after I proposed a crackdown on organized crime. Draw your own conclusions. No more questions.]Noburo, his Bodyguards and his knock-out Secretary pile into two waiting limos amid a flurry of shouted questions that will remain unanswered. Just before he gets in the car, Noburo looks ACROSS THE STREET TO: Shingen, emerging from the ambulance, his wounds hidden under a new suit. The Reporters rush to get his statement. As Noburo gets in his limo, Shingen steals a look at Noburos back, smart enough to know he was being watched, smart enough not to let on. EXT. HOTEL - BALCONY - DAY LOOKING DOWN FROM A DIZZYING HEIGHT as Logan drops to the top floor balcony and forces the door with a single claw. He looks up at us and extends his arms. ANGLE ON: Mariko, seated on the edge of the rooftop. The balcony is a short drop - no more than twenty feet. But to miss it is a fall of several hundred. Without hesitating, she drops. Logan catches her. She wraps her arms around his neck, holds him tightly.  34.'b'INT. LOGANS PALATIAL HOTEL SUITE - BATHROOM - LATERThe opulence of the suite provided by Zen stands in stark contrast to the wet, bedraggled occupants entering. Logan carries Mariko across the threshold. Mariko is chilled to the bone. Logan rushes into the shower, clothes and all, turning the water on full. He tries to put her down, but she clings to him, staring into his eyes. He moves to speak and she puts a hand on his mouth. She doesnt want to talk.  When he tires to talk anyway, she kisses him. Then the gentleman gives way to the animal...INT. PALATIAL HOTEL SUITE - BATHROOM - LATERA trail of wet clothes leads from the shower to-INT. PALATIAL HOTEL SUITE - BEDROOM - NIGHT/DAY-the bed where Mariko sleeps peacefully. Logan stands over her, wounded look on his face, put there by deep suffering in his forgotten past. AN anguish without a name. DISSOLVE AS: The sun rises. Logan has hardly moved. Mariko stirs, looks around, about to ask did we? LOGANYou were asleep before you were out of the shower. She is at once relieved and disappointed. MARIKOHow long have you been-LOGANAll night. Pause. Logan stares at Mariko.MARIKOThe way you look at me. LOGANWhat about it?35.'b"MARIKOI remind you of someone you used to know.LOGAN.No... Someone I used to be...She studies him for a moment. MARIKOWhy are you here? In Japan. LOGANAre you really going to marry him?This catches her off guard. She recovers. Nods. LOGAN (CONTD)Just like that.MARIKOIt is my duty. I accept that. LOGANBut is it what you want?MARIKOWhat I want doesnt matter. I serve something greater. LOGANThe House of Yashida.MARIKOYou understand.LOGANNot really. MARIKO... You should sleep.LOGANI gave it up.She smiles, doesn't buy it. After a beat: MARIKOCome.She moves over in the bed, making room for him. Logan hesitates, but her eyes insist. He sits on the bed, unsure. Mariko gently pushes him back on the pillow. 36."b'She touches his cheek, tracing a finger gently across his lips, his eyebrows.MARIKO (CONTD) Close your eyes.(as he does)When I was a little girl I had terrible nightmares. My father would say go back to sleep. Face your fears. LOGANTheres a few fears Id like him to meet.  MARIKO(ignoring this)My grandfather was different.LOGANTell me about your grandfather. MARIKOYou knew him.LOGANWe only met briefly. MARIKOAnother time. Where was I?LOGANYour father said face your fears.MARIKOAh, yes. He did. But my grandfatherwould tell me stories about Kuzuri.A fierce and terrible creature that would do whatever I commanded. He would protect me from my fears.  LOGAN... Kuzuri.MARIKOMmm-hmmm. Half-man, half-beast - a heart filled with rage... And six... long claws. He opens his eyes. She nods: You heard right.LOGANDid the nightmares stop?37.'b'MARIKOYes... But even as a little girl, I never believed he was real. She touches his eyes, closing them gently.MARIKO (CONTD)So now... Kuzuri... Do as I say. Close your eyes. And let me watch over you. She kisses him once, twice, a third time. Logan beings to respond, but then: MARIKO (CONTD)Now sleep. He closes his eyes and exhaustion takes over as: MARIKO (CONTD)He needs help, Zen. INT. PALACIAL HOTEL SUITE LIVING ROOM - LATERMariko whispers into the phone. Logan sleeps fitfully in the next room, tortured by his nightmares. ZEN (ON PHONE)That does not mean you have to-MARIKOHe saved my life . I am in his debt. Long silence. Zen sighs. ZEN (ON PHONE)What do you want me to do? MARKIOYou came here looking for me. You did not find me.(when there is no reply)Say it. On your word. ZEN (ON PHONE)I came there looking for you. I did not find you. You... have my word. MARKIOI will be home in a few days.She hangs up before Zen can say another word and walks back into the bedroom to be with Logan. 38.'b'CLOSE ON: Logan as he closes his eyes, as the warm pink light of sunrise on his face gives way to the bright light of day, the tangerine of sunset and the pale blue of night. His eyes open with a start. PULL BACK TO REVEAL: Darkness outside and a full-moon over Tokyo. Logan is alone, a rhythmic tapping O.S. INT. PALATIAL HOTEL SUITE - LIVINGROOM- NIGHTCandle-light, a warm fire. Logan comes out of the bedroom to find the table set for two, Mariko is in the kitchen putting the finishing touches on dinner. MARIKOSit. She brings him something more akin to art than dinner. MARIKO (CONTD)Eat. And he does.CLOSE ON: The dinner table as the moonlight fades to pale blue, giving way to sunrise again. The dinner plates are gone replaced by breakfast.  The sun rises and sets two more times as Logan and Mariko live a stolen, ordinary life. Standing in front of the massive bay window overlooking Tokyo, Mariko teaches Logan the slower, more graceful forms of Aikido - a discipline for which he has no patience. Balancing on one foot he manges to fall more than once, but in time, he and Mariko move in perfect unison. Combat becomes meditation and - in their case - a dance.  She also teaches Logan how to cook, with an emphasis on cutting tools. Every meal is an unconscious lesson in perfecting the use of edged weapons. Logans claws are offered to help and summarily rejected. Logan is a disaster with chop-sticks, determined to eat with his fingers. Mariko slaps the back of his hands any time he even tries. He uses his claws like skewers to stab his food and Mariko surrenders.  39.'b'INT. PALATIAL SUITE - BEDROOM NIGHT Each night she lays him down, talking softly in his ear, holding his hand or rubbing his shoulders - then watching over him while he sleeps fitfully, touching him reassuringly at the slightest sound of distress. And, each night, he sleeps a little easier. INT. PALATIAL SUITE - BEDROOM - LATERMariko is picking up his clothes when something drops from his pocket and plunks on the carpet. She picks the object up, her expression darkening. INT. PALATIAL SUITE - BEDROOM - DAWNCLOSE ON: Logans eyes rolling behind his eyelids in REM sleep. He wakes not with a start, but a mere flinch, happy to find Mariko watching over him.MARIKOAnother nightmare? LOGANNo. A dream.He smiles. She doesnt. She holds out her palm, revealing the green pearl. There is fear in her eyes. MARIKOWhere did you get this?LOGANWhat is it with that thing? Mariko signs and sits on the edge of the bed.

The ancestral home of the Yashida family, high in the hills overlooking the Port City of Agarashima.40.'b'High-walled, sparsely-lit garden pavilions, elegant, understated buildings, sprawling gardens, a placid pond. An oasis. A fortress. A home in mourning. INT. YASHIDA STRONGHOLD - SHINGENS OFFICE - DAYCLOSE ON: Two ancient, magnificently ornate swords. The symbols of a venerated family empire. They are behind Shingen, seated at his desk, his collar open, hands to his temple, a bandage on his forearm. He is surrounded by ADVISORS and STAFF, all in dark suits. ADVISORWe have done what we can to control the press, but... word is quickly spreading that you personally fought off the attackers.Shingen looks up at him as if to say: So? ADVISOR (CONTD)You have honored the family name, Sama.SHINGENWhere is my daughter ? All of the Advisors shift uncomfortably. ADVISORThe... police have every available man looking for Mariko... and they are interrogating the assassin who survived. But...SHINGEN... But. ADVISORHe is not a kidnapper, Sama. He is an assassin. SHINGENWhat about this other man? The gai-jinwith the...At a loss for words, he holds up three fingers on each hand.

LOGANMarked...MARIKOBy the Black Clan.(as Logan scoffs.)It is said they do not eat or sleep until theyve killed their intended victim. But first they send a warning. A single, sea-green pearl.LOGANCome on. What sort of assassins tellyou theyre coming?MARIKOAssassins bound by a strict code of honor. They do not kill for a living. Killing is their way of life... it is their faith. And this pearl is a warning. Your only chance for survival. LOGANYeah, howzzat?MARIKOAccording to myth, you must challenge their master and kill him in combat. Not only will you be spared.. You will become the new Master of The Clan. LOGANDone. Who is he?MARIKOThat is the riddle. No one knows.  42.'b'Logan laughs, bounces the pearl on the table. MARIKO (CONTD)It is no laughing matter. You should leave. LOGANJapan?MARIKOTonight.LOGANIm not ready to do that. MARIKOLogan... why did you come here?LOGANThats a long story. With a lot of holes.MARIKOTell me.Logan smiles, shakes his head. Mariko places her hand on his arm, speaking firmly now.  MARIKO (CONTD)Youre safe here. Tell me.Logan casually opens his mouth to speak but he freezes, at a loss for words. It isnt that he wont speak. He cant. We hold on him for the longest time as he struggles to tell her who he is, what he is. But the harder he tries, the harder it becomes. His eyes burn with tears, his face trembles, overcome with centuries of repressed emotions, lifetimes of forgotten pain. Logan is paralyzed. MARIKO (CONTD)Im here for you, Logan. Im here. Talk to me...She wraps her arms around him, holding him tight. INT. PALATIAL SUITE - BEDROOM - DAWNLogan sleeps soundly. And for the first time when he wakes, he does so slowly, quietly. At peace. LOGANI didnt dream. Not at all. 43.'b"He looks, expecting to find Mariko. But she isnt there. Confused, he gets up, walks expectantly to: INT. PALATIAL HOTEL SUITE - LIVING ROOM - DAWNSilent. Empty. No food on the table. No candles, no fire. The television silently shows the funeral aftermath.  Noburos flabby face fills the screen.  Curious at first, Logan moves from one room to the next, his anxiety increasing. He cannot find Mariko. Then he finds a note, resting on the table by her grandfather's sword. He unfolds it. It reads.Kuzuri-Go where you will, looking only to the future.    I go where I must, taking comfort in the past.-MarikoLogan lets the note fall to the floor, stunned. Crushed. He might stand there all day but then: He freezes, sensing something. He follows his keen ears to the front door, listens for a beat then: With blinding speed, he rips the door open, grabs A MAN form the hallway, pins him to the wall and SCHINK- presses the tips of his claws tot he mans chin. But then the killer look leaves Logans eyes.ZENIve turned a blind eye long enough. Where is she?LOGANI get the feeling she doesnt want to be found.ZENMr. Logan, please...Logan lets him go. Zen walks into the suite, looking around for Mariko. LOGANWheres the information you promised me?Zen is momentarily confused. 44."b'LOGAN (CONTD)Who am I. Where I come from. What was done to me and why. You said you had answers. Where are they?ZENI... I told you. What you seek will be yours when you-LOGANHonor the gift that was given to me, yeah, yeah- Shes not here. Zen stops searching, turns back to Logan.LOGAN (CONTD)So your master spared my life. As far as Im concerned I spared his. Since then I saved his son and his granddaughter. The way I see it, the old man is into me for some honor - not the other way round. So give me what I came here for. ZENThere is more to honor than doing what is so obviously right.LOGANWhat other kind of honor is there?ZENWhen you can answer that, you will have the peace youre looking for. LOGANZen, I gotta tell you, youre being kind of a stereotype right now. Just a little bit.ZENWe have no time for this. We have to find Mariko. LOGANWhen were you going to tell me about the Black Clan? Zen cant hide his surprise. Beat. ZENWould you have believed me?  45.'b'LOGAN Doubt it.

ZENI mean put her out of your mind. LOGAN(facing Zen)My mind? What makes you think I trust my mind, Zen? My mind is broken. (points to his heart)I trust this. This is never wrong. This never forgets. It goes where it wants... And when it gets there it stays... Forever. (turning back to the window.)I didnt ask for that. Anymore than I asked to be... what I am. ZENIm sorry, Logan. Truly. But even if she were not promised to another man, she could never be for you. She is noble blood. Sole heir to the House Yashida. You are. LOGANSay it... Unworthy ...Zens silence tells him he is right. Logan nods bitterly, used to that sort of thing. He thinks, grabs his jacket, heads for the door. LOGAN (CONTD)I may not be worthy in the eyes of your precious family... But I can save it. ZENWhere are you going? LOGANSomeone wants to kill Mariko. And her father. Now theyll have to deal with me.And the door slams behind him, blending nicely with the sound of twelve hundred pounds of slapping fat.  48.'b'INT. SUMO ARENA - DAY The rippling back of a SUMO WRESTLER, his diapered back-side roaring toward us, feet scrambling for purchase. The wall of blubber flies over our head andWHAM- Lands like so much uncut Kobe at Logans feet where he sits calmly puffing a cigar in the front row of a CHEERING, CHAIN SMOKING AUDIENCE.  ON THE PLATFORM ABOVE, THE WINNING SUMO raises his arms in victory, flinging sweat. Logan blinks, rubs one eye, disgusted but cool. Then he looks over at: AN EXECUTIVE BOX containing a DOZEN MEN IN SHARK-SKIN SUITS and SUNGLASSES. Kurusawas Goodfellas. The Mob.YAKUZARank is obvious, factoring age, body-language, amount of overall movement. The OLDEST MAN, mid-60s, sits dead center, motionless, with GOONS whispering in each ear. He is obviously the top dog. The Big Man.THE OYABUNLogan studies the box for a while then stands and heads that way. It takes a moment before he sense someone walking in step behind his right shoulder. He stops, turns, comes to face to face with: YUKIOLOGANThe hell are you doing here?YUKIOI am your bodyguard. LOGANMy what? YUKIOYour bodyguard. Orders of Mr. Zen.LOGANGo wait in the car.Yukio doesnt move. Logan sighs. LOGAN (CONTD)I dont have time to spar with you.

Thats what they call him, right?The Oyabun does not react, even if every other Goon in the box does. The Bodyguards press close, one of them jabbing a gun in Logans ribs.LOGAN (CONTD)Youre going to have to eat with a fork when Im done with you-VOICE (O.S.)YOU. Logan turns. A SLICK, LEAN GANGSTER, Japans answer to Frank Sinatra , stands in the box, pointing at Logan. Over his shoulder, the Oyabunsits stone-like.

SINATRAThe stones on this guy. How do you walk those stones? Sonkei .But Logan is not laughing.SINATRA (CONTD)Let me ask you something, Cowboy. Does The Oyabun look stupid to you? LOGANReally?SINATRADo you have any idea the heat we have on us right now? Do you have any idea the heat we would have it Shingen was dead? Does The Oyabun look like a man who likesheat? Asks for it? Sends button men to a funeral? In broad daylight ? The Minister of Justice sitting there? LOGANYoure saying you didnt try to put a hit on Shingens family? SINATRAWe took a bid, sure. We dont run a tea shop. And the job was for Shingen only.No one else. The money was tempting too. But we turned it down.  LOGANWho was the  bidder? SINATRAHey, whoa.

As for you... The only reason you dont have a bullet in your eye right now is the Oyabun thinks youre funny.

Noburo inhales to scream and: SCHLICK - A second set of claws spring forth, the middle blade gently resting on Noburos tongue. LOGANShhhh.Dont want to wake the babe.Noburo glances to his left where a TRAMPY YOUNG WOMAN is sleeping, snoring slightly, a hand-cuff dangling from one wrist. One the floor we see an assortment of leather props and sundries. Noburos a freak. LOGAN (CONTD)Tying up a few lose ends before the wedding? Noburos eyes darken. Startled, but not scared.

SCHINK- His claws retract, leaving a hairline cut down the center of Noburos tongue. Noburo laughs. LOGAN (CONTD)You need counselling, bub.NOBUROMe disgrace Marikos family? I am the only thing standing between her and disgrace. The Old Man was a fool. How much money do you think was left after a lifetime wasted helping the sick and the poor? Where d you think Shingens money comes from now? Its the first rule of money, gai-jin. Behind every green fortune... is a crime. Logan considers this, knowing its unusually true. NOBURO (CONTD)And youre wrong about the truth. It doesnt have to come out, Not if you marry the man in charge of looking for it... TAKE HIM.Logan springs without looking half an instant before an arrow punches into the head-board directly over Noburo. A single drop of liquid drips from the shaft and onto Noburos forehead. He screams as: Logan rolls and comes up on his feet. A second bold catches him between his neck and shoulder. It over-penetrates, exposing the narrow steel tip, Steaming poison drops from a hollow point. CLOSE ON: A mechanical, auto-loading compound crossbow swiftly prepping another shot. A pair of slender, GREEN GLOVED HANDS shoulder the crossbow to REVEAL THE FACE OF: 56.'b'NOBUROS SECRETARY, no longer in her business-attire, but a skin-tight, backless green number, complete  with a black gun-belt and boots.

This is VIPERKA-SHUNK KA-SHUNK KA-SHUNK -The crossbow spits out bolts, two per second. Logan dodges, charges, closing the gap and hacking the crossbow in two. But, nimble minx that she is, Logan cant seem to catch Viper. In turn, she draws her pistol and fires, but she cant stand still long enough to place a shot. Logans claws rake her forearm. She drops the gun but never makes a sound.  She pulls a knife, deftly avoiding his claws. Logan catches her wrist, driving his claw deep into the wall, slamming his body into hers. Shes pinned. Time stops. Logan and Viper are nose-to-nose now, breathing hard. She has the slightest smile. Logan looks at his forearm, marked with a single superficial cut one that doesnt heal.

Just then, POLICE CARS drive up to the Hotel and a dozen police jump out. Logan slinks into the shadows - a fugitive now.  EXT. TOKYO BACK-ALLEY - NIGHTAgonized, trembling, he huddles between two dumpsters, fading in and out of consciousness. ACROSS THE ALLEY: Bright lights blaze through the floor-to-ceilings windows of a clean white room. Inside, MEN IN WHITE KARATE GIS all black-belts practice champion-level martial arts. This is not a school about show. These guys play for keeps, honing their skills with open hand knives, swords staffs. Logan stares at tis absently until his eyes go.  BLACKNo sound. A bright flash. Sparks. A liquid casket. Red-hot molten metal, an explosion of steam. Logans dreams mix with semi waking reality in feverish delirium images of war and anguish blend with the increasingly intense fighting of the martial artists. THAT WOMAN walks down a long, windswept beach - then her limp body in Logans arms. Then the Young Soldier in the Jungle, nodding to him, running away to live another day. Then Noburo. Mariko. Shingen...NOBURO (V.O.)Behind every great fortune... is a crime. Logan opens his eyes to the blaring of car horns, the noise of traffic and blinding sunlight. We are: EXT. TOKYO BACK-ALLEY - DAYHis wounds have closed, but they have not fully healed. In fact, they look almost... human. The martial arts school is empty. Maybe it always was. Logan stands, a determined look in his eye. He walks out of the alley, through the dense foot traffic and into the street. A horn blares, breaks shriek, a truck skids to a stop, just missing him.61.'b'Logan ignores it, keeps walking. A TRUCK DRIVER screaming at him from behind the wheel. We notice a name emblazoned across the trucks container: YASHIDAEXT. SHIPYARD - DAYMATCH FRAME to an identical container. PULL BACK SLOWLY TO REVEAL another and another... then thousands more.

In the distance, cranes off-load and upload hundreds more per minute, to and from ships of all nations.He stops, follows his nose to one  container in particular. He scowls.

As far as I am concerned, you are responsible for this...maneven being-63.'b'Shingen freezes, looking past Logan and Zen. Zen turns and freezes as well. Logan just inhales.LOGANHello, Mariko.She stands in the doorway, a blank look on her face.SHINGENHow long have you been standing th-LOGANLong enough.MARIKOIs it true what Logan says?SHINGENAbsolutely not. Logan has twisted lies and circumstantial evidence to fit his predetermined conclusion. All In misguided attempt to fulfill some cryptic bargain he had with your grandfather. Shingen opens his desk drawer, pulls out a stack of legal paper and throws it on the desk. SHINGEN (CONTD)Its all there in his will.(to Zen)What is this thing my grandfather left him? Give it to this gai-jinso he can leave us in peace. ZENLord Shingen, your fathers will was explicit-SHINGENExplicit ? Honor the gift that was given to you? Honor, he says.

You have impugned my familys name. 64.'b'SHINGEN (CONTD)You have publicly implicated one of Japans oldest families in a crime. You. A fugitive. MARIKOWhat is this? SHINGENHe broke into Noburos home last night and assaulted him. Then he attacked his secretary. Zen and Mariko both look at Logan in shock. MARIKOIs this true?LOGANNot the way he tells it.Wrong answer. Zen bows his head. Marikos hand goes to her lips, stunned. LOGAN (CONTD)Mariko, your father is using you. ZENFor Gods sake, Logan, hold your tongue. LOGANHes corrupted your grandfathers legacy for profit and hes selling you to the Minister of Justice for protection.SHINGENHow dareyou?LOGANOkay, say Im wrong. D you love him? Do you love Noburo?He speaks to feelings she can never openly admit. She struggles to remind herself: MARIKOI... Have a duty to my family. LOGANThats not what I asked. I asked if you love him. 65.'b'He asks as much for himself as he does for her. Mariko looks down.  SHINGENI am her father. She is my heir.LOGANIm not talking to you, Im talking to her.Logan never takes his eyes off of Mariko. She struggles to answer him, tears in her eyes.LOGAN (CONTD)Mariko...

A blow that would kill any other man. He lands on his hands and knees, a bruise swelling, not fading. Shingen stands over him holding two wooden swords. He lets one drop to the carpet.SHINGENDefend yourself.LOGANAfraid to use a real blade?SHINGENThe wood is not for my protection, Logan-san.Shingen strikes Logan rolls, grabs the sword and springs to his feet. Zen pulls Mariko out of the way. Shingen attacks with the speed and ferocity of a man twenty years his junior. Logan is in immediate retreat, doing more blocking with his body than his blade. The duel carries them into: INT. YASHIDA STRONGHOLD - LIVINGROOM - DAYWhere the destruction is wholesale. Furniture, china, windows, art. Nothing is spared as the two men go head-to-head, sword-to-sword. Shingen is an artisan. Logan is a brute. And the brute is losing. 66.'b'But a strange thing is taking place. For all the pain he suffers, Logans focus on Shingen is unwavering - the way he moves, the way he attacks. LOGANS P.O.V.Shingen in slow motion, the looseness of his wrists, his grip on the sword.  CLOSE ON: Logans hands as they adjust, relax, learn. Shingen attacks again. With each strike, Logan becomes stronger, faster, more adept. And then:WHACK- Logans sword catches Shingen in the ribs, sending him back hopping on one foot. Real pain. LOGANThey made me a quick study, old man. Keep it coming. Shingen focuses, attacks. The speed of swords increases, the bone-jarring impact decrease. Soon, the blades are a blur and neither man seems able to strike the other until: WHACK- Another strike snaps Logans sword in half. WHACK- Shingen hits him in the ribs. Logan backs up, defenseless. Shingen presses the fight. Logan blocks the wooden blade with his forearms, taking the pain.  WHACK- Shingen catches Logan in the jaw. Logan struggles to stay on his feet. Hed love to kill Shingen, only Marikos presence holds him back.  SHINGENHe is not human, Mariko. You saw that for yourself. What you have not seen is the true nature of the beast. WHACK - Mariko cries out. Zen cannot bear to look.SHINGEN (CONTD)He is determined to hide his true self from you.(WHACK)But I-(WHACK)Will bring it-(WHACK)OUT. Shingen swings with everything he has for Logans neck and: 67.'b'SCHINK-WHACK - Logans claws hack Shingens sword in two. He grabs Shingen by the throat, driving him into winding up to drive them home when: MARIKOLOGAN. Time stops, Logan is suspended in a state of pure rage, unable to back down, unable to finish. He sees the look of horror in her eyes - sees what she sees in him now. Shingen sees it too. But he is too cool to smile or gloat. Instead: SHINGENI give you... the beast.Logan seems to melt back into something more human, claws retracting slowly, his grip on Shingen loosening. And with the melting comes devastation. SHINGEN (CONTD)Out of respect for my father, I will give you the opportunity to leave Japan. Tonight.Logan ignores this, turning to: LOGANMariko-MARIKOLeave... Please... Leave this house and never return.Crushed, Logan walks out. When he is gone, Shingen turns angrily to Zen.SHINGENWhat is this thing my father left him in his will? And where is it?ZENWit hall respect, your father instructed that only Logan-SHINGENMY FATHER IS DEAD. I AM YOUR MASTER NOW YOU WILL ANSWER TO ME. ZEN(trembling with anger)Your father lives...68.'b'ZEN (CONTD)So long as I honor him. Under pain of deathI will not answer.SHINGENDeath and pain... are two verydifferent things, Zen. And the way he says it chills Zens blood. Then: SHINGEN (CONTD)You are discharged. Leave this house at once.  MARIKOFather-Shingen silences her with a look. With tears in his eyes, Zen bows to Shingen, then Mariko and leaves as:A bell tolls long and slow, over and over, deep and resonant. A ring to inspire a sense of mourning.  INT./EXT. BUDDIST TEMPLE - DAYCherry blossoms fall like snow as Shingen escorts Mariko resplendent in generations-old bridal regalia - up the stairs of an ancient pagoda. At the top of the stairs, Noburo waits in black tails and white gloves,looking like an emperor penguin.

BUDDIST TEMPLE GATE - DAYWEDDING GUESTS wave as Mariko and Noburo depart in black horse-drawn carriage. A fairy-tale nightmare. PULL BACK TO REVEAL: Logan, standing in a grove of softly molting cherry trees, watching the carriage leave, his eyes betraying unbearable anguish. PULL BACK FURTHER TO REVEAL: Yukio, behind the wheel of a limousine in a long line of same. Her cat-like eyes peer over her sunglasses at Logan. CLOSE ON: Mariko in the carriage, sitting stone-like slightly dazed. Noburo gently pats her hand, patronizing, cold. Neither of them notice: 69.'b'KENUICHIO , that angry young man from the funeral, standing unnoticed by the temple wall, glowering at the departing carriage. Death in his eyes. Then: CLOSE ON: A stack of thin paper - at least one thousand pages - a familiar, crisp, typewriter paper, yellowed with age. A pair of hands picks up the stack and turns it over. The top sheet reads: PROJECT: WOLVERINE  Followed by dense military jargon. PULL BACK TO: INT. HUMBLE APARTMENT - NIGHTSmall, sparsely furnished. A SMALL SHRINE in the corner features a portrait of OLD MAN YASHIDA. Its just the sort of place you would expect Zen to live. ANGLE ON: A section of floorboard has been carefully pulled up, revealing a deep hole.Zen seals the contents of Project Wolverine in a metal box and places it in the hole before putting the floorboard back in place. It fits perfectly. He stands, brushes dust off his hands and: WHAM- He flinches as the door bursts open. Viper stalks in, followed a beat later by Shingen. Zen Is confused to see them together. SHINGEN(re: Viper)My eyes, my ears... and occasionally... my teeth. (shutting the door)It is my daughters wedding day, Zen. You did not send a gift. Zen takes a half-step back.CLOSE ON: The handle of a small knife on the desk behind Zen just a few paces away.SHINGEN (CONTD)This made me wonder if I had not... offended you somehow. I thought to myself, perhaps I have been too harsh with Zen. Zens right hand drops to his side, just a short reach from the knife handle. 70.'b'SHINGEN (CONTD)Then another part of me thought... I have not been harsh enough. ZENI know what youve come for, Lord Shingen. I thought I made myself clear; you cannot make me talk.SHINGENNo... I cant... But she can.Viper holds up a steel syringe, the five inch needle dripping thick amber liquid. Zen lunges for the knife, grabbing the handle just ask: THWACK- another knife pins his hand to the desk. Zen screams in pain. ANGLE ON: Shingen, frozen at the end of his throw, pleased with his marksmanship. He turns to Viper. SHINGEN (CONTD)By all means take your time. Viper smiles and moves toward Zen. We cover Zens scream with the steam whistles and rattling steel of: EXT. TOKYO WATERFRONT - NIGHT Not far from the rail-yards, the city itself is a distant gleam. We settle on a run-down bar. INT.

A WOMANS SLENDER HAND catches it. Meanwhile:  CLOSE ON: Logans shot-glass as he pours. Just as the whiskey reaches the brim, another shot-glass slides in next to his, pushing it aside and slowly filling. Logan looks up, letting his woozy eyes focus on: 71.'b'A STUNNING PARI OF CAT-LIKE EYES, under a hanging shock of otherwise closely-cropped hair.

A hand reaches for it. The fly zips away. PULL BACK TO REVEAL: Shingen, the pages spread out on the desk - some dense with military jargon, others containing schematics, diagrams, eerie da Vinci-likesketches of dissected arms and legs. And claws. PROJECT: WOLVERINE Shingen sits back, contemplating what he has read, turning a silver letter opener on his fingers. Viper enters and sits, putting her feet on the desk.VIPERWell... what is it?SHINGENIts his life. A life he cant remember. And several other lies they implanted to try and hide it.VIPERThey...Shingen hands her a few pages. As she reads. 72.'b'SHINGENEven if he could remember... he would never know what was truth and what was fiction. Not without this.He gestures to all of the paper on his desk.VIPERDoes it tell you anything useful.Shingen holds up a finely detailed schematic - a densely rendered cut-away of Logans body, complete with lines pointing to specific vitals. SHINGEN Hes as easy to kill as any other man. One just needs to be precise. Shingen flings the letter opener and we hear it strike O.S. Viper turns to find the letter opener stuck in the doorjamb - impaling the fly. VIPERFirst you have to find him.SHINGENYou forget who I am...

RAIL-YARD - NIGHT Logan is hammered, taking a long pull of whiskey. Yukio is under his arm, propping him up as: LOGANSome day Im going to murder the bugler/Some day theyre gonna find him dead/Ill amputate his reville/And step upon it heavily/ And spend the rest of my life in-Logan trips and falls, taking Yukio down with him.

You want some pizza? YUKIOEventually.She kisses him. We notice the knife handle sticking out the back of Yukios belt. LOGANMarikommmm.YUKIOYeah, okay.CLOSE ON: LOGANS EYE, springing open, realizing. He grabs Yukio and tries to roll over. She wraps her legs around him and pins him back, kissing him hard.LOGANGet... off.YUKIOIm trying.74.'b'The harder he fights, the harder she digs in. Finally he grabs her by the throat, pushing her back. She looks down at him with a wild look in her eyes. YUKIO (CONTD)YES.Logan shoves her and they roll over as: AN EXPLOSION OF SOUND. A screaming wall of steel streaking past at two hundred miles per hour. Logan and Yukio have been making out between the rails of a bullet train. Yukio is laughing, Logan is yelling at her. We cant hear any of it until the train is gone: LOGAN-US BOTH KILLED.YUKIODeath is waiting for all of us. Might as well make it interesting.And she means it.LOGANYoure crazy.YUKIOAnd worth all the trouble. She kisses him again. He shoves her back, stands - wobbly, but sober from adrenaline. He walks away. YUKIO (CONTD)Where are you going? LOGANAustralia.YUKIOAw.Come on. It was just getting-THUNK- Something clouts her on the side of the head and knocks her out. She falls without making a sound. ANGLE ON: Logan, calling back over his shoulder.LOGANLook, youre a very nice girl. And by that I mean smokin hot and completely out of your mind which has one very invigorating upside, b-75.'b'He turns to finish and freezes. Yukio is gone - vanished - despite wide open space in any direction. LOGAN (CONTD)Yukio?(tense beat)YUKI-VVVVVVVP - An arrow pierces Logans forearm. Where you might scream:LOGAN (CONTD)What the-VVVVVVVP - Another arrow through his other forearm. That hurt. He goes to grab it but his hand is pulled back. Each arrow is attached to a long, thin cord. Annoyed, he tries to extend his claws. But they extend only an inch or two. The arrows have disabled them. Suddenly Logan is stretched in two directions at once, the pain intensifying.VVVP-VVVP-VVVP - more arrows, more cords, more pain. Then A DOZEN FIGURES emerge from the darkness - MEN IN BACK KARATE GIS, short hair slicked back and glistering skin died black as pitch.  LOGAN (CONTD)You must be the Black Clan.(beat)That ink you have on? Hides your scent. Very clever. Each man draws a blade - nothing fancy. There are no flashy moves. No bullshit, showboat choreography these men are hunters. And Logan is a snared trophy. LOGAN (CONTD)Tell you what Im gonna doe. Let me go now, and Ill leave you with some back teeth for chewing. But the keep coming.LOGAN (CONTD)Guys, guys guys. Seriously. Ive been drinking. It makes me mean. Still they keep coming.  Logan sighs. LOGAN (CONTD)Damn. This was a nice jacket, too.76.'b'Despite the pain, Logan grabs the arrows by their heads and pulls them through his forearms. SCHINK-Then he cuts the cords before attacking the stunned Men of the Clan. Theyve seen a lot, but never that. But their amazement is short lived. Without a sound - not a scream, not a yell, not even the sound of feet on loose gravel - twenty-four men with swords attack: Meanwhile: EXT. RAIL-YARD - ELSEWHERE - NIGHT CLOSE ON: Yukio, a smear of blood on the side of her head, a bruise on her temple. Her eyes flutter open to the sound of clanging steel O.S. PULL BACK TO REVEAL: She is flat on the ground behind a railroad car, her hands bound behind her back. Instinctively they reach for the blade back there, finding only an empty sheath. She lays on her belly and contorts, her entire body curling backward until he heels nearly touch the small of her back. She pulls a three inch blade from her boot and slashes through her restraints.  The she kicks off her boots, exposing something shiny in the lining. Meanwhile: EXT. RAIL-YARD - NIGHTLogan deliberately, literally, meets a blade head-on.CLANG- The sword has cleanly split the skin on Lognas forehead, but not his skull, much to the stunned bewilderment of the swordsman. Logan growls and his claws close in, pincer-fashion, on the swordsman. SCHLUNK - Logans head heals as he catches the mans sword letting the body fall. He grips the sword in hands bristling with blades, cocking it like a bat. LOGANLet it be said... I did warn you.He charges. They charge. Meanwhile: THWIP THWIP THWIP - Three of The Clan go down, clutching their necks. Yukio emerges from the darkness, her left fist full of scalpel-like knives. She snatches up a sword as she runs through the gap shes created, landing back-to-back with Logan.  77.'b'LOGAN (CONTD)Thought Id lost you there.YUKIOAnd miss out on getting killed by The Black Clan? Never? LOGANI preferred the bullet-train.YUKIOAre you asking me out? LOGANPlease try to focus.The Black Clan circles, studying, looking for a weakness. They nod to one another as if reading each others minds. Creepy.  LOGAN (CONTD)COME ON. YUKIOHey man, if youre in a hurry...Yukio screams and attacks.  LOGANChicks out of her mind.He goes after her - met halfway by two flailing swordsmen. He takes one out but the other drives a sword clean through his belly. Another swordsman attacks from behind, stabbing Logan through the back. Logan screams, grabs the blade of the swordsman in front of him and drives it through his own body, impaling the swordsman behind him.  He grabs the swordsman in front of him and impales him on the blade protruding from his belly. We notice the swordsmen die with oddly peaceful expressions. Eerie. As they both fall, the man behind Logan takes his blade with him. The man in front leaves his sword in Logans belly. He pulls it out and uses it to challenge all comers. LOGAN (CONTD)WHOS NEXT. WHO IS NEXT. YOU?But no one will fight him. The Men of the Black Clan back away and drop to their knees, bow their heads. 78.'b'Stillness. Logan is woozy, neck bulging in severe pain. He collapses. Yukio kneels beside him - astonished as she watches his wounds slowly heal. Suddenly, A NEW MAN is there - wearing the same black clothes as the others but with no ink on his face. It is a placid, serene face. Young. Strong. But not a killer. More like a MONK. Thats what well call him. As the Monk studies Logan, the surviving Men of the Black Clan nod, one by one, almost like a vote. The Monk kneels and places an object on Logans chest. CLOSE ON: A SINGLE, BRILLIANT WHITE PEARL. The Monk stands and walks away as A DOZEN MORE CLAN emerge from the darkness, implying an inexhaustible supply. They gather the bodies of the dead and dying and vanish into the shadows. Not a single sound. Logan grabs the pearl in his bloody fist and tries to stand but cant. Yukio tries to help, but he is dead weight. She grabs him by his tattered leather jacket, dragging him along the gravel. Logan screams in pain. Yukio looks around: empty rail-yard as far as the eye can see - no sign of life, no help. Its a last cause, but she wont quit. She is walking backward, her pace slowing until she hits a wall of steel. She drops Logan, turns and comes face to face with: SILVER SAMURAIBravely, Yukio grabs for a blade without thinking. Sadly, she isnt fast enough. FWACKBLACKNo sound. A bright flash. Sparks. We are looking down at a vaguely human form submerged in a tank of water. But this is not Logans dream... What emerges this time is shining metal, water sizzling off in sheets. Steam clears TO REVEAL: Armor. The tachyon-charged suit of Silver Samurai.Logans eyes spring open. He sits up suddenly as: SCHINK- He readies to fight. 79.'b'YUKIOWait-WAIT.Yukio rushes to him, grabbing his writs and gently urging him back. Logans eyes focus on: INT.

She has a thing for getting run over by trains. KENUICHIO(ignoring this)I had hoped to find their master and challenge him. I wish to be Master of the Black Clan.  81.'b'LOGANNot a doctor?

Being as Im marked for death and you seem to be the guy to ask, who is the Master of the Clan? KENUICHIOWas.LOGANPardon? KENUICHIOWho was the Master? He is dead, as far as I can tell.

KENUICHIO (CONTD)For as long as I can remember, I have dreamed of receiving such an honor. It is the mark of a true warrior. And now it is yours. Logan takes the simple pearl, suddenly imbued with intense symbolic power. After a beat: LOGANSo... what happens next? KENUICHIOYou will kill or be killed.(off Logans look)You have no choice in the matter. Your opponent will hunt you to the ends of the Earth to win the prize.LOGANWhat if neither of us want to be Master? KENUICHIOYoure saying you dont? LOGANWell... Ive got my thing.

STREET - NIGHTA remote section of industrial Tokyos warehouse district. Desolate at night. Logan and Yukio step out as a massive steel door closes slowly behind them. LOGANIll say this... Lord Shingen has one messed-up family.YUKIOThis matters to you?LOGANIt matters to Mariko. Her fathers disgraced the family. And shes caught in the middle of it with no one to help her.YUKIOYou have problems of your own right now. Youre wanted by the police, not to mention the Black Clan-LOGANThat can wait. Right now I need to help Mariko. She needs to see that her father is her own worst enemy. 84.'b'YUKIOHow can you prove that? LOGANSomewhere in that third bottle of hooch my mind went back to the funeral - the men who tired to kill Shingen. Someone wanted him dead. Someone had a reason. My gut says that reason is the key to everything. If I could just find out who gave the order...But its hopeless. Until: YUKIOWhen Im lost... I go back to where things began. Logan considers this and nods. LOGANYoure right... Youre absolutely right, Yukio.(starts walking)Thanks. Ill see you around.YUKIO(going after him)Where are you going?LOGANTo see a sick friend.YUKIOIll go with you.LOGANNot this again, please.She grabs his arm, stopping him.YUKIOI can help you.LOGANSome people are gonna get hurt.YUKIOThen I can really help you.LOGANWhats Shingen giving you for following me?85.'b'Her smile fades. She tries to play dumb until: LOGAN (CONTD)My bodyguard, Yukio? Come on. Awkward pause. Then Yukio caves.YUKIOIm an orphan. Not even a half-blooded Japanese. Shingen promised to be my master. A servant of the House Yashida. Can you understand what that means? LOGANIt means youre a servant with better clothes.YUKIOHe said youre a mindless killer - that you threatened his daughter. I can see now that he was lying. I can tell youre an honorable man. Logan scoffs. She drops to one knee. YUKIO (CONTD)I wish to serve you, Logan-san.LOGANYou wish to serve the next Master of the Black Clan, you mean.Yukio cant hide her wry grin. YUKIOThis had also crossed my mind.LOGANThere wont be a death-match, Yukio. Im not gonna be the Master of the Black Clan. YUKIOBut you heard Kenuichio. You have no choice. LOGANI neverhave a choice, That doesnt mean I have to play along. He turns and walks away. Again she follows. 86.'b'YUKIOPlease. Logan-san. Take me with you.LOGANLeave me alone. YUKIOIll show you I am worth-He turns, showing enough rage to stop her cold. LOGANDont you get it. I want to be alone. I dont need you, I dont want you and certainly dont trustyou. NOW GET LOST.Yukio recoils but stands her ground, her eyes filing with tears. He raises a hand and now she backs away. LOGAN (CONTD)GO. YUKIOI should have let them kill you. Yukio turns and runs. Only then do Logans eyes betray his true feelings. He turns and heads the other way, disgusted with himself.  INT. FORGE - NIGHTKenuichio at the window, watching Yukio and Logan part ways. VOICE (O.S.)You should have killed him.KENUICHIOAfter the new Master is chosen.And from out of the darkness, Viper emerges to stand at his side, taking his hand.VIPERDo you think you can kill him?KENUICHIOWith your help? Its certain. But first we deal with Mariko. 87.'b'KENUICHIO (CONTD)When she is dead, I will be Shingens only child. He will have no choice but to recognize me as his sole heir. He looks around at the Forge with disgust. KENUICHIO (CONTD)Then, finally, I can emerge from the shadows and be called by my true nameVIPERKenuichio Yashida.KENUICHIO(taking her in his arms)And when the House Yashida and The Black Clan are gone... No one... No one... will ever ignore me again. They kiss. And as they do we MOVE IN CLOSE ON: A NEEDLE in Vipers hand. It pierces the back of his neck and he shivers. Whatever this concoction is, it works for him. He smiles, looking deep into her eyes. VIPERNever forget who you love. Never forget who you serve.KENUICHIONever... Never.And they kiss again. EXT. TOKYO METROPOLITAN HOSPITAL - NIGHT Est. INT. TOKYO METROPOLITAN HOSPITAL - CORRIDOR - NIGHTMOVE SLOWLY down a corridor toward TWO POLICE OFFICERS standing guard outside a private room. Quiet at this hour, save the sound of heart monitors, the faint chatter of nurses, the odd page on the PA. We linger long enough to get used to it. Then: A faint sound stirs the Cops from their thousand-yard stare. They share a look, wait. They hear it again. 88.'b'Ka-chunk Ka-chunk - Very far away. They open the door they are guarding and look into: INT. TOKYO METROPOLITAN HOSPITAL - PRIVATE ROOM - NIGHTA MAN lies in the only bed- a mass of tubes, casts and traction wires sucking air through a mask. Thanks to his distinctly ruddy complexion, we recognize: THE PIT-FACED THUG who cut Shingen at the funeral.The Cops share another look, shrug, close the door. Then we hear the sound again: Ka-chunk Ka-chunk Ka-chunk.EXT. TOKYO METROPOLITAN - TEN STORIES UP - NIGHTTHE SOURCE OF THE SOUND is Logan, legs dangling, sweating buckets, arms strained to the breaking point. All six claws are sunken into the brick facade of the hospital. After a brief rest, he tears the left claws out and drives them back in again - slowly scaling down the otherwise smooth wall- KA-CHUNK KA-CHUNK KA-CHUNK - until he finds himself dangling by the window hes looking for. He hangs from one hand and uses the other to slice the latch.  INT. TOKYO METROPOLITAN HOSPITAL - PRIVATE ROOM - NIGHT CLOSE ON: Pit-Face, his chest rising and falling as he struggles to breathe. A hand comes into frame and gently removes the oxygen mask from his face. Pit-Face gasps. His eyes open to find Logan looming.LOGANRemember me? Pit-Face tires to speak, to call out. His hand reaches for the remote call button, but Logan takes it away without effort. LOGAN (CONTD)Easy. Eeeeeeasy.He puts the mask back in place and Pit-Face breathes, eyes fluttering with relief.  89.'b'LOGAN (CONTD)I was hoping to avoid bettering you but Im fresh out of options. And I know youre supposed to be resting so Ill be brief. Who hired you to kill Shingen? Pit-Face manages a brave front, shakes his head. LOGAN (CONTD)I know, I know. The cops asked you a hundred times already and you told em you dont know nothin.But - bein they were cops - Im willing to be they didnt say the magic word. Logan pulls the mask off again. Pit-Face eyes widen, his heart monitor starts racing.LOGAN (CONTD)Please... Tell me who hired you to kill Shingen. SCHINK-Logan extends his claws to the tangle of tubes connecting Pit-Face to life, adding tension.LOGAN (CONTD)Pretty please....The heart monitor races faster, taking us to-INT. APARTMENT CORRIDOR - NIGHT- where Logan emerges from the elevator. He compares the Japanese characters on the familiar  business card in his hand to those on the name plates of each door. He finds the one he wants and notices the door is already ajar. He pushes it open and finds: INT. HUMBLE APARTMENT - NIGHTZen lyingon the floor - swollen purple track marks on his forearm. Logan rushes to him and kneels. LOGANZen. Ah, geeze ... Zen. Who did this to you>?Zens eyes are slits, his voice a trembling whisper. 90.'b'ZENShingen.Logan notices a hole in the floorboards. Empty. Zens eyes fill with tears. ZEN (CONTD)He took what ...belongs to you. I tried to resist... drug... too strong... I failed you. So ashamed. LOGANZen... It was you that hired those men to kill Shingen, wasnt it? Zen tries to resist, then nods.LOGAN (CONTD)Why? ZENPlease...LOGANWhy? ZENShingen...ordered...me.LOGANI dont understand. Shingen wanted the Yakuzato come after him? To his amazement, Zen manages a nod, exhaling. Spent. LOGAN (CONTD)Why?ZENThe Black... Black...LOGANThe Black Clan...(thinks, realizes)He needed to prove himself in combat... Is that it? Shingen wants to be chosen. He wants to be the new Master of the Black Clan. He had to fight those men to prove himself worthy. Zen nods. Logan shakes his head bitterly.  91.'b'LOGAN (CONTD)And I helped him...(things a beat)What else havent you told me? ZENPlease... No more... I swore an oath... To my master.LOGANWell now youre gonna break it. The Old Man brought me here for a reason, Zen. What is it? Tell me? Zens eyes drift to the Old Mans portrait. ZENFirst you must remember... He was a good man... an honorable man...LOGANSure... And then what happened? ZENYears ago... Master of the Black Clan... wanted war... Killed those... in his way... Yashida came home... Japan destroyed... angry... heartbroken... Yashida went looking... for Master of the Clan. PUSH IN ON the portrait as Zen takes Logan back and: SHINGEN (PRE-LAP)What do you mean you losthim? INT. YASHIDA STRONGHOLD - SHINGENS OFFICE - NIGHTSLAP- Yukio takes five across the eyes from Shingen, bravely straightening up for another.YUKIOI did as you instructed. I seduced him. I tried to learn his intentions. But we were attacked.SHINGENAttacked. Attacked by whom? YUKIOThe Black Clan.  92.'b'SMACK- Shingen backhands her with such force Yukio drops to her hands and knees, blood trickling from her mouth. Her eyes darken: That does it. We stay CLOSE ON her face as Shingen paces above her.SHINGENIdiot.If it were The Black Clan you would not be here.YUKIOThey couldve killed us, Im sure.(pausing for effect)Instead they gave him a gift.SHINGEN(stops pacing)What... kind of gift.? Yukio smiles to herself. Shes got his full attention now. With her voice she continues to play fearful.YUKIOA pearl. A single white pearl. Perhaps it has symbolic meaning.CLOSE ON: Shingen unable to hide a mix of emotions.SHINGENWhat did Logan think it meant?Yukio hesitates, weighing her loyalties.SHINGEN (CONTD)STAND AND SPEAK.YUKIO(standing)He... he thought it was a peace offering. A sign of surrender.SHINGENArrogant fool.YUKIOThen he became angry. He accused me of betraying him,. Of leading him into an ambush. (pointing to her bruised temple)Thats when he struck me. When I woke up, he was gone. Long, tense moment. She studies him as he states into space, wondering if hes buying any of this. Finally. 93.'b'SHINGENLogan is an animal. As I said. YUKIOYes. As you said, Lord Shingen. Shingen snaps out of his thoughts, locking eyes on Yukio now. Does he know shes lying? Tense pause. SHINGENYou may call me Master.Yukio is stunned. Deep emotions well up inside her. YUKIO... Master? He puts a hand on her shoulder. She flinches, then looks at his hand, aching for a father. But this one? SHINGENThis information is of great value. You have done well, Yukio. You are now a servant of the House Yashida.Stunned, conflicted, Yukio bows.YUKIODomoarigato, Sama.Shingen waves her away. She backs out of the room, wiping tears from her eyes. When she is gone, Shingen turns to face the window, his reflection a specter over the whole of the port city below. SHINGENHim... They chose him. How could he be worthy and not I? How could-SCHINK-Three blades appear across his throat - the top one pressing tightly against his jugular. Shingen does not dare to move. But he shows no fear.  HE studies the blades in his reflection as they slowly, silently retract. To our confusion, the top and bottom blades retract left-to-right. The middle blade retracts right to left. Shingen turns to face: THE MONK and TWO MEN OF THE BLACK CLAN, each holding one knife - the blades he thought were Logans SHINGEN (CONTD)I... have been expecting you.  94.'b'The Monk throws a punch, his fist stopping just a hair from Shingens nose. Shingen doesnt blink. The two men behind the Monk nod. He nods in return. He turns his fist over and opens it TO REVEAL: A SINGLE, BRILLIANT WHITE PEARL. Shingen inhales ever so slightly - the closest thing to a bridal-gown gasp hell ever produce. He  extends a hand. The Monk drops the pearl in Shingens palm. Shingens eyes follow it. SHINGEN (CONTD)I am most deeply humbled by the-But when he looks up, the Monk and his cohorts are gone. Shingen looks down at the pearl greedily. VOICE (O.S.)Master. I-Shingen shuts his fist as Yukio enters, oblivious.SHINGENWhat is it, Yukio.Her eyes flick to his hand as he casually places it behind his back. She bows. YUKIOApologies, Master. I came back to ask if you wish me to find Logan again. Or are you done with him? SHINGENOh, by all means find him. Im not quite done with Logan yet.CLOSE ON: Yukio bows and leaves, her smile fading quickly, glancing back at Shingen studying something hidden in his palm with the wonder of a child. BLACKAnd the sound of blasting steam. A bright flash. Sparks. A vaguely human form emerging from a tank of water. A red-hot skeleton on a steel grate. Horrific. 95.'b'INT. SMELTER - DAY Shingen observes STEEL-WORKRERS as they pick up pieces of the glowing skeleton with iron tongs. CLOSE ON: NUMEROUS HANDS assembling the skeleton, connecting joints with wooden pegs and leather. PAN OVER TO: Schematics taken form the box intended for Logan - blueprints for the design of Logans own adamantium skeleton. PUSH IN ON THIS AS: A SERIES OF DISSOLVES carry us over: INT. NOBUROS BEDROOMMariko in a night-gown at a dressing table, removing make-up, revealing the unhappy woman underneath. She looks in the mirror at: Noburo, his corpulent frame lying on the bed in black socks, boxers and an undershirt, snoring. INT. WORKSHOP - NIGHTViper studies the crossbow bolt pulled from Logans shoulder and the traces of dried blood there. She then consults select pages from PROJECT: WOLVERINE.CLOSE ON THE HEADINGTOXINS: KNOWN VULNERABILITIES INT. FORGE - NIGHTKenuichio carefully sharpens the edge of his sword with a well-worn stone, resting a piece of paper on the blade and watching its own weight cut the parchment in two. Then he sharpens some more. INT. YASHIDA STRONGHOLD - NIGHTShingen in a workout room, shirtless, honing his martial arts skills on something O.S. He hits it with hands, swords, spears, knives, the intensity of the workout ever-increasing until we: 96.'b'PULL BACK TO REVEAL: His practice dummy: A blackened steel copy of Logans skeleton - right down to his six claws -arms raised in defense.  Sinewy leather joints it together. Animal-hide bladders - representing internal organs - fill the chest cavity. Shingen learns how to avoid Logans indestructible skeleton altogether. From across the room, he throws a knife with stunning accuracy - the blade passing between two ribs, impaling the soft heart. With a simple short sword he charges, hacking off one arm at the elbow, the other at the shoulder. Then he strikes the neck precisely, finding the space between two tightly fitted metal vertebrae and: SCHAK- Logans skull rolls across the floor.  A winded, sweating Shingen smiles. Ready. INT. LIMOUSINE - NIGHTWe end on Yukio, staring up at the forboding YashidaStronghold - her home if she wants it. But does she? She shakes her head as if to say she regrets what she is about to do. Then she puts her car in drive. INT. GAMBLING PARLOR - NIGHTTracking shot through the energized chatter of a smoke-filled late-night underground city of sin for the international high-roller. Lots of tables, all of them packed - a large bar backed by a mirrored aquarium filled wit choral and man-o-war jellyfish.  Its strictly jacket-and-tie. Stunning women decorate the men who can afford/dont deserve them. Big money changes hand, most of it Euro and Yuan. The Oyabun himself plays dominoes with a few minions. AT THE BAR Sinatra, (or at least Japans answer there-to) keeps one eye on the scene while fending off numerous carnal opportunities. Then she walks in: She wears a red dress cut dangerously low, a slit up one side riding scandalously high. Men step aside at her approach as if she might set them on fire. One has to admit, Yukio cleans up nice.  Sinatra sees her coming and quickly shoos a BRAZILIAN BOMBSHELL off her stool. 97.'b"Yukio eases into the opening and offers a mind-melting smile before whispering in his ear. Sinatras smile fades to disappointment. He stands, looks Yukio up and down, and motions for her to wait. INT. BACK OFFICE - NIGHTSinatra enters to find Logan, shuffling cards, bored. A caged animal. Sinatra jerks his head.SINATRAYou know this biscuit? Through the one-way glass making up the aquariums mirrors back, Logan sees Yukio at the bar. He sighs. LOGANAh hell.SINATRAYou want I should take care of her? LOGANYou dont mean kill her. SINATRAI mean marryher. She's got legs up to her neck.LOGANShe say what she wantsSINATRAHas information for you. Wouldnt say what. Says youd know what it is about just by looking at her. Through gently drifting tentacles, Yukio sips a cocktail. A ring conspicuously parked on her finger features a large white pearl. SINATRA (CONTD)So are you two... uh- LOGANNo. SINATRA(smiles/straightens tie)Got her number? LOGANIm not sure I do. 98."b'INT. BACK OFFICE - MOMENTS LATERSinatra shuts the door behind him, leaving Yukio and Logan alone. She sits opposite from him and crosses her legs, letting the slit in her dress say hello.LOGANHow did you find me? YUKIOWho lese could hide you on a tiny island full of short people? LOGANWhat do you want?YUKIOThe police arent the only ones looking for you. Shingens been chosen by The Black Clan. He knows you have been, too.LOGANHowdhe find that out?YUKIOSlip of the tongue.LOGANIf I kill him, you wont have a master.YUKIOWho says I want him dead? Logan shakes his head and smiles. She smiles back.YUKIO (CONTD)What will you do?LOGANMaybe Ill turn myself in. I can do thirty years standing on my head. Spend it watching Shingen trying to break into jail so he can kill me.YUKIOHardly practical.LOGANBut funny.She drops the cool act and leans in. 99.'b'YUKIOEveryone has someone theyd like to know was dead. They may not want to do the deed, but theyd like to know the deed was done. Someone whos escaped justice. Someone willing to harm the innocent. Someone who cares more about power than they do about human life.(offhis blank look)Come on, Logan... Master of The Black Clan. The finger of God. The power to take life with no fear of consequence. Doesnt that tempt you in the least? Still Logan says nothing. She stands, waving a dismissive hand and turning for the door.YUKIO (CONTD)Why do I bother? Shingen is my master now. I win if you lose. I have nothing to gain by convincing you to fight. Then she lunges, kissing him deeply. He might even kiss back. In ends with a bite. A little anger. Then: YUKIO (CONTD)For Gods sake, fight.LOGANCant do it Yukio.YUKIOWhy?(whenhe doesnt answer)Never mind. I know why. She turns and opens the door TO REVEAL: MARIKO in a raincoat, hiding behind big sunglasses.Logan stands, stunned to see her. Yukio holds a hand out. Mariko gives her a large bundle of cash. Then, scoffing, Yukio walks out. Alone now, Logan and Mariko stare at one another for a moment, each unsure what to say. Finally, Mariko takes off the shades TO REVEAL A RAISED BRUISE on her cheek. Make-up hides A SMALL CUT ON HER LIP. LOGANNoburo?100.'b'She nods ever so slightly, her lip trembling. CLOSE ON: Logan. A flash of rage, a tide of fury. Then he takes her arm in his arms, closes his eyes, exhales to the bottom of his soul, whispering: LOGAN (CONTD)Its all right. Im here.MARIKOIm so sorry.LOGANYoure sorry? What for? MARIKOYou only wanted to protect me. And I rejected you.LOGANI knew youd come around.This almost makes her smile.MARIKOI went to see Zen at the hospital. You may have saved his life.LOGANHe may have saved mine. MARIKOYukio told me what she could. Zen said you would tell me the rest.LOGANYou know about The Black Clan. That your father and I have been chosen.(off her nod)Did you know your Grandfather was the last Master of the Black Clan? Mariko is shocked.LOGAN (CONTD)He used The Black Clan to make sure Japan would never see another war. But someone discovered his secret and challenged him... That someone was your father.Marikos hand goes to her lips. 101.'b'LOGAN (CONTD)Your Grandfather was faced with an unthinkable dilemma. To win, hed have to kill his only son. If he lost, The Black Clan would belong to Shingen; a man willing to kill his own father for power. MARIKOAre you saying... my father... killed my grandfather?LOGANYour grandfather was smarter than that. No... he took his own life. He deliberately left The Black Clan without a Master.And now tears fill her eyes.LOGAN (CONTD)The last thing he did was mark me for death. A man hed met only once. But a man hed been watching for seventy years. A man he knew better than his own son. He knew when The Black Clan faced me  Kuzuri- they would choose me as a champion.MARIKOBut my grandfather was a good man-LOGANHe was a great man. Cursed with a terrible responsibility. Confronted with a terrible choice. He did the best any man could do. And now he expects me to avenge his death... To restore his familys honor. But to do that, Id have to kill his only son... Id have to kill your father. Mariko considers this dilemma until she accepts the inevitable, prove her mettle: MARIKOThen you must honor his wish.Logan is at once impressed and saddened.LOGANNo. 102.'b'MARIKOYou mustnt think of my feelings. Think of Japan. My family. LOGANMariko, as long as I dont face your father. The Black Clan will have no master. Japan will be free to choose her own destiny - for better or worse. MARIKOMY father will hunt you for as long as he lives. LOGANThen the jokes on him. But she is not amused. LOGAN (CONTD)Hey, Ive been on the move for as long as I can remember. At least now itll mean something.MARIKOThen take me with you.Logan wasnt expecting that part. His heart swells, but he stuffs it back down.  LOGANYou dont know what youre asking.MARIKO(pointing to her bruised face) Look at me. I know exactly what Im asking. She kisses him. Logan gives in, taking her in his arms. She buries her head in his chest. MARIKO (CONTD)I dont even know you. And yet...LOGANYou know Ill always protect you. MARIKOI do... I do...The door opens. Sinatra stops halfway through when he sees whats going on. Just past him we see Yukio. She sees Mariko in Logans arms and quickly turns away. 103.'b'LOGANWere adding a passenger.SINATRAWe have plenty of room.The low bellow of a ships horn takes us to: EXT. TOKYO WATERFRONT - NIGHTWhere a massive cargo freighter is casting off its moorings and getting ready to make way. Three Mercedes sedans race to the edge of the pier. Logan, Mariko, and TWO YAKUZAGOONS get out of one. Sinatra, Yukio and SIX GOONS get out of the others. Logan hears a thumping noise coming from the back of Yukios car. She tries to look innocent. Logan pops the trunk TO REVEAL: Noburo, bound and gagged, putting up quite a squawk. Logan glares at Yukio. She shrugs.YUKIOWhen I went to get Mariko he put up a fuss, so...LOGANPut him back.YUKIOFirst thing tomorrow-LOGANTonight.Logan slams the lid. He shakes hands with Sinatra. Yukio looks jealously down her nose at Mariko. Mariko, behind Logan, smiles back.SINATRAIf youre ever back this way.LOGANNot ever.SINATRAThen sayanora , Logan-sa-A deafening explosion of glass cuts him off. 104.'b'ANGLE ON: SILVER SAMURAI leaping off the crushed roof of a Mercedes , drawing his sword in mid-air as: SINATRAS EIGHT GOONS all draw weapons and fire.LOGANDont-He grabs Mariko and covers her as a hail of bullets ricochet off of Samurais charged armor and kill six of the goons before he lands. Once on the ground, a single sweep with his sword takes out the other two.LOGAN (CONTD)TAKE HER. Sinatra grabs Mariko as: SCHINK- Logan attacks. Not to be out-done, Yukio kicks off her heels and, with a single yank, rips off the business end of her evening gown, exposing a harness high up on each thigh filled with scalpels. Sinatra gets Mariko into a car before turning and pulling a pistol, aiming at Samurais back.WHAM- Samurai mule kicks him without even looking. Sinatra is out in the same instant.Logan and Samurai charge at one another, colliding in mid-air. Logan has learned a lot since their last encounter and he knows not to let his claws linger too long. We notice that his hands, despite his claws being extended, are open and flat - not fists. His movements are more elegant, less brutish. With his time in Japan, Logan the warrior has evolved. Yukio keeps Samurai distracted. She cant do much with strikes, but shes good with those scalpels and manages to get them between the plates of his armor. Not deep enough to kill, but certainly painful. LOGAN (CONTD)TAKE MARIKO AND GET OUT OF HERE.YUKIOI STAY WITH YOU.LOGANYOURE GONNA GET YOURSELF KILLED.YUKIOGLORIOUSLY -105.'b'WHAM- Samurai cracks her across the face and sends her flying, raising his sword to finish her off. Logan leaps onto Samurais back - the armor throwing off bolts of energy and burning his flesh. Logan takes the pain, grabbing the brow of the Samurais helmet from behind,and locking his feet into the small of Samurais back. Logan pushes with his feet and pulls with his hands, causing Samurai to bend back impossibly. Samurai screams in agony, flailing his sword behind him, trying to stab Logan. LOGANGO. NOW. Yukio gets to her feet, runs for the Mercedes containing Mariko as: Samurai presses a recess in the Red Sun on his chest.FOOM-A supercharged shock-wave blows Logan off his back. Logan skids across the pavement, convulsing. Samurai drops to his hands and knees, gasping for air. He ears the Mercedes engine starting and turns. INT. MERCEDES - NIGHTYukio just gets the car in gear when: MARIKOLOOK OUT.Samurais blade hacks horizontally through the windshield. Yukio ducks as the sword cuts off the headrest of her car-seat. She sits up again andWHAM- A metal fist comes through the window and knocks her out cold. The car is in gear. It rolls. Samurai rips off the back door and drags Mariko from the car, coming face-to face with his sister for the first time. She looks at his eyes through his visor, unafraid. His eyes soften with admiration. Then he remembers himself and drags her past: Logan, Just now recovering, struggling to find his feet. Samurai swings. Logan blocks and: SCHUNK- Logan howls in pain. CLOSE ON: Samurais blade between Logans claws and deep into the center of his hand. Meanwhile: 106.'b'INT. MERCEDES - NIGHTYukio come to, dazed. Unaware the car is moving, she opens the door and steps out, landing hard. The Mercedes rolls off the pier and into the water. The trunk opens on impact, REVEALING NOBURO - eyes wide with terror - just before the trunk inhales water and the car sinks like a stone. ANGLE ON: Samurai, as he kicks Logan onto his back.SAMURAIAccept your destiny, gai-jin. Go to the Stronghold. Face Shingen. If not, she dies. WHACK - Samurai kicks Logan under the chin, snapping his head back and knocking him out cold. Mariko is dragged away, looking back at Logan as things go: BLACK INT. YASHIDA STRONGHOLD - SHINGENS OFFICE - NIGHTWHITE GLOVED SERVANTS take down the Yashida Family swords, carrying the precious relics reverently. INT. YASHIDA STRONGHOLD - NIGHTViper scrapes the small traces of Logans dried blood from the crossbow bolt into a porcelain bowl, mixing it with a minute amounts of other compounds in a thin glass tube, distilling it over an open flame. The result: A SINGLE DROP OF BLOOD RED LIQUID. The care with which she handles it tells us it is highly lethal.LATER: Viper melts pale green wax over a candle until it is the consistency of water. She adds the single drop of red liquid to the green wax, mixing it in. LATER: she dips A DAGGER, its blade ornately engraved, into the molten wax. As it cools, the wax in the blades engraving appears pale green - more like patina than lethal poison. 107.'b'INT. YASHIDA STRONGHOLD - TEMPLE - NIGHTShingen prays on his hands and knees, incense burning, sensing a presence. Opening his eyes. Viper offers the green-bladed dagger.VIPEROne cut... And youll kill him.Shingen shakes his head, no. Viper grins, shrugs. VIPER (CONTD)If all else fails. He reaches for the blade but stops himself, unsure.SHINGENVictory without honorVIPERBut certain victory. Now shes got him. Shingen considers this temptress, his hands hovering over her knife, interrupted by: VOICE (O.S.)SHINGEN!INT. YASHIDA STRONGHOLD - GREAT HALL - NIGHTSamurai, still in his armor, helmet under one arm, casts a long shadow across the floor of the grand entrance. He holds Mariko by the wrist.

When he sees Samurais face: SHINGEN (CONTD)You.SAMURAII have come home, father.MARIKOFather? 108.'b'Mariko blinks. She can tell by her fathers face that Samurai is not speaking metaphorically. Shingen descends to greet his bastard face-to-face. SHINGENHow dare you show your face here. How dare you lay a hand on m-SHING- Samurai drops his helmet and draws his sword - the tip cracking just under Shingens chin. SAMURAI-mysister. SHINGENWhat do you want?SAMURAIThe animal is coming to claim her. You will face him Whoever is left will face me and then I... Will be Master of The Black Clan. Shingen considers, clearly plotting. Then: SHINGENVery well. I accept. Let her go.SAMURAIYou are not the Master yet. SHINGENIgnorant boy... I am Lord Shingen of the House Yashida, standing in the great hall of my ancestors and I am telling you now... I willwin... In fact, I cannot lose. The sound of a weapon cocking O.S. Samurai hauls Mariko in front of him, his blade to her throat as a figure appears at the top of the stairs.  Viper aims a crossbow right at him. Samurais eyes widen, his soul drops.SAMURAINo...SHINGENYou see? I gave you more than you ever knew...109.'b'Viper smiles, shrugs, What can I say, kid? Samurai lets Mariko go, heartbroken. Shingen waves to Viper. She lowers her weapon. SHINGEN (CONTD)The boy has too much potential.(to Samurai)It would be a shame to waste it. EXT. YASHIDA STRONGHOLD - FRONT GATE - NIGHTLogan and Yukio arrive in her car. Guards merely glance at them before letting them pass. EXT.

JAPANESE GARDEN - NIGHTA full moon casts cold blue light over a magnificent garden complete with ponds, bridges, pagodas - like a painted backdrop fora grand staging of the Mikado. Ground lights come on, one by one, illuminating a light mist in the trees, simultaneously making the landscape more visible and creepy. The last light illuminates the open center of the garden and: MARIKO, more worried for Logan than herself. Logan takes half a step. Yukio grabs his arm, stopping him. YUKIOJust... wait. Shingen and Viper step out from the shadows on one side of her. Silver Samurai steps out from the other. 110.'b'ANGLE ON: The Monk, draped in shadow, looking down from atop the high garden wall. Watching. Waiting. SHINGENAre you ready to face your destiny?LOGANSure, why not?SHINGENThen come forward.LOGAN Mariko leaves with Yukio first. SAMURAIShe leaves when I am satisfied.Logan sighs, whispers to Yukio.LOGANIs everybody here such a blowhard? She shrugs: pretty much. Logan approaches his opponents as they form a wall in front of Mariko. Shingen wears a robe bearing the Yashida symbol - the familys two swords in the sash around his waist. EXTREME CLOSE-UP AS: He reaches inside his robe, adjusting the POISON DAGGER PREPARED BY VIPER. He took the dishonorable option after all.Logan stops a few yards from Shingen. Yukio just behind him. Logan and Viper make eye contact - the first time since their lethal encounter at Noburos. LOGAN (CONTD)Dont youget around? She shrugs, smiles. Samurai bristles at the remark.SHINGEN(to Yukio)You may go.YUKIOI stay with Logan.SHINGENThen youll die with him. 111.'b'YUKIOBetter I die serving him than live serving you.LOGANNow, now, were all friends here.SAMURAIKill this dog, Shingen.LOGAN(re: Samurai)Look at this vulture, waiting to feast on the leftovers.(to Shingen)What say we team this punk? Then you and me can settle up as the main event. SAMURAI(drawing his sword)IMPUDENT -SHINGENENOUGH. Samurai freezes humiliated Yukio laughs Viper shakes her head embarrassed for Samurai. SHINGEN (CONTD)(to Logan)I expected you to bring dishonor to this affair. (to Samurai)But you? Where is your dignity? (backto Logan)You think you can turn y our opponents against one another and steal a victory. As a man with no interest in the prize at stake, that is your advantage. Logan smiles at Samurai.LOGANHes smarter than you.SHINGENPick up your weapon. Thats when Logan sees an object on the ground a few feet in front of Shingen: Old Man Yashidas sword. 112.'b'SHINGEN (CONTD)An appropriate choice, I thought.LOGANI wont be needing it, thanks. SCHINKSHINGENI had hoped we could fight man-to-man. Not man-to... mechanism. Logan considers this.YUKIO(quietly, to herself)Dont doooiiiit.LOGANYarright.SCNICK- his claws retract. LOGAN (CONTD)Man-to-man. MARIKONo...SHINGENI have your word of honor, then.LOGANFor what its worth.Logan hooks a toe under the scabbard and kicks the sword up into his hands. He draws the blade and inspects the weapon he first saw seventy years ago. Shingen slowly draws the ancient blade of his family, placing the flat side reverently to his head. After a short prayer, he holds the sword in both hands, getting into position with a flourish. Logan just stands there. Sword at his side. Pause. SHINGEN... Begin. Shingen attacks. Mariko gasps. In a flash, Logan brings his sword up one-handed, blocking a strike aimed right for his neck.113.'b'Shingen steps back, waits... Strikes again. Again Logan blocks him, then lets the sword hang. Shingen adjusts, moving in combinations of  blows rather than single, precise strikes. Again, Logan manages to block. The energy of the fight leaves one with the impression of a train leaving the station, gaining in speed and intensity, steel on steel, hitting faster and faster. Logan grips the sword with both hands now, his form matching Shingens until blades collide five times a second and still...Shingen cannot hit Logan. Shingen stops, steps back, a little winded, the blades ringing in a long, sustained chord. Viper is in awe. Samurai is impatient. Mariko trembles. And Yukio smiles. Shingen screams and attacks with renewed ferocity. Logans blade responds ass if magnetized, meeting Shingens no matter what direction it comes from.ANGLE ON: The Monk, expressionless, emotionless, watching from high atop the garden wall. Keener eyes will notice two more Men of the Clan are with him. Shingen stops again, frustrated. YUKIOYou cant hit him.LOGANI told you. I was built to learn. And youre one hell of a Sensei.SAMURAI(to Logan)Finish him then. LOGANNo. SAMURAIKill or be killed. That is the contest.LOGANStuff your contest. I wont kill him. And he cant kill me.(to Shingen)Take as long as you like, baldy. I got all the time in the world. 114.'b'No more composure, Shingen freaks- charging at Logan with everything he has. Logan moves back, sideways, around, absorbing every move in Shingens arsenal. The Lord of the House Yashida is reduced to a primal shrieking maniac. Logan is the picture of calm. Then: SNAP Time stops. Shingen holds up his family sword, the blade snapped in two. He throws it, draws his short sword and goes after Logan again. But now its just sad. Logan has reach on him. Shingen cant win. SHINGEN(to Samurai)Together. We take him together. Samurai cannot hide his surprise.SAMURAIThat is not the-SHINGENThey can choose another champion.LOGAN(to Shingen re: Samurai)Sooner or later youll have to face him. And having fought you both I gotta say... The kids got you beat Shingen. What with all that armor. SAMURAIILL FIGHT HIM WITH MY BARE HANDS.LOGANBig man.SHINGENKenuichio presents no real threat to me. SAMURAII dont?LOGANHe doesnt? SHINGEN (CONTD)Im your father, Kenuichio. Kill me and what will you be? Master of The Black Clan? Perhaps. But what name? What house? You will still be living in the shadow. Without a father to call your son you are, and always will be, nothing. 115.'b'CLOSE ON: Samurai - the eyes behind his mask show hes been hit on a gut level. SAMURAII am nothing now. What difference does it make? SHINGENSwear your loyalty to me. Here and now. I will acknowledge you as my son.  I will name you my successor. Mariko is stunned. Samurai slowly removes his helmet to better hear words he has waited for all his life.SAMURAIAnd The Black Clan?SHINGENYou will swear off any claim to The Black Clan until I am dead and gone. Then you will earn the right to be chosen, just as I have done. You will fight for your fathers prize just as I do now. With a champion... Chosen by The Clan. LOGANUse your head, kid. Hes sucking you in. Dont do it. SHINGENThe Empire my father left will be nothing compared to the one I leave you. I will extend the shadow of The Black Clan until it covers the Earth. Bow to me... and in time it will all be yours. Samurai considers things very carefully. Logan grimaces. Hes in the shit now. After a beat: SAMURAII accept your terms... Father. Shingen smiles. Logan wince, nods to Shingen.LOGANWell played. SAMURAI On one condition. 116.'b'LOGANUh oh. SAMURAII must have a guarantee.SHINGENI give you my word of honor. What better guarantee is there.SAMURAIThe word you gave to my mother? Before she killed herself? Your word means nothing to me. I pledge my sword to you here and now, father. But... I must be the sole heir to the House Yashida. The sole living heir. All eyes shift to Mariko now. Terrified, she looks to Logan, then to Shingen. He looks at his daughter with deep pity, a tinge of regret. Then he sizes up Samurai, Logan, his overall chances...SHINGENVery well..MARIKOFather-SHINGENKill her.In a flash, Samurai turns his blade on Mariko.In that same instant: Logan attacks Samurai. In that same instant: Shingen attacks Logan. LOGANLITTLE HELP HERE.Yukio springs into action. Viper cuts her off, drawing the knife she sued on Logan, that familiar amber oil dripping from the blade. Yukio forgoes weapons of any kind and sticks with hand-to-hand. Five  bodies dance around Mariko in a blur of blades, fists and feet. Logan is taking hits now, fighting a two front war - Shingen trying to hit his vitals, Samurai trying to get past him to kill Mariko. The resulting frustration leads to anger, angerturns to rage. His rage boils over and Logan goes completely, totally, utterly117.'b'BerserkLogan swings his sword at Samurais chest, the blade exploding like glass. Samurais armor holds, but the force of the blow momentarily staggers him as: Shingen swings his blade at Logans neck for the kill. To his horror, Logan spins and catches the speeding blade with his bare hands. It cuts his flesh, but not his adamantium bones. Meanwhile: Samurai closes on Logan from behind, distracted when: Yukio throws a roundhouse kick to the side of Vipers head, dropping her before firing a scalpel at Samurai, slicing his cheek. Enraged, Samurai attacks Yukio. She just barely stays ahead of his sword as: Logan grips Shingens glade, feeling no pain, enraged. Shingen is scared of him now. He lets his sword go with one hand and reaches into his robe, PULLING OUT THE GREEN DAGGER. THE DEATH BLOW. But as he lashes out with the dagger, Logan tears the sword from Shingens grasp and clubs him over the head with the handle. Shingen goes down. CLOSE ON: The green dagger tumbles into the grass as: Logan throws Shingens sword, the adamantium visible through his flayed palms. Samurai sees his moment. Forgetting Yukio, he stabs Logan in the back. Logan screams and turns, striking the sizzling blade with his elbow and ripping it from Samurais hand. The blade stays wedged in Logans body, crackling. Viper staggers to her feet and lunges at Yukio. Yukio catches her. They Grapple for Vipers knife as: Logan roars and kicks Samurai square in the chest. Samurais heavy armor adds to his momentum and he stagers back and falls as: Viper sweeps Yukios legs and drives her to the ground, jumping on top of her and coming down with the knife in both hands as:Logan turns to Mariko.LOGAN (CONTD)PULL IT OUT. DO IT.118.'b'He turns his back to her. Mariko cant bring herself to touch the weapon. CLOSE ON: A drop of poison dangles from the tip of Vipers trembling blade, just above Yukios eye. As: Samurai gets to his feet and heads for Logan. LOGAN (CONTD)DO IT. DO IT NOW. Mariko tears the blade from Logans back. In one fluid motion he spins, snatches the sword from her hand and comes back around to meet Samurai. WA-CRACK - The charged blade hits the charged armor. Samurai and Logan are both blasted back. The resulting, waist-high shock-wave of energy knocks Mariko flat and blasts Viper off of Yukio. Silence. Samurai - his armor no longer charged - is the first to stir, shaken and dazed, but protected by his own armor from real harm. Logan, meanwhile, struggles to sit up, overwhelmed by his wounds. Samurai hauls him up by his neck.WHACK- Enraged, he punches Logan with his armored fist over and over, squeezing Logans throat with his other hand. Logans neck snaps back repeatedly until: SCHUNK - A scream of agony. Samurai drops on his knees, clutching the upper half of his right arm. CLOSE ON: The severed forearm of Samurais glimmering armor lying in the grass.CLOSE ON: Samurais sword still clutched in Logans hand. That is until Logan throws it. LOGAN (CONTD)Maybe now you can teach.MARIKOLOGAN.He turns, but too late.SCHUNK- And Logan gasps. PULL BACK TO REVEAL: 119.'b'Shingen, his broken family sword buried up to the hilt in Logans belly. He savors it, pulls the blade out and lets Logan drop down on all fours. Logan is badly wounded, unable to get up. Shingen stands over him, triumphant. He rests his sword on the back of Logans neck, much like his father did seventy years ago, marking his spot. SHINGENOne just needs to be...precise.He raises the sword to strike and...Yukio attacks him. Shingen senses her coming, turns and back-hands her. Yukio is out cold. Shingen raises the sword above his head. Logan is too weak to resist. Then Shingen freezes. His face changing when he sees: SHADOWS moving at the top of the garden wall. Dozens of them, rising one by one. Silent. More shadows emerge from the garden. Suddenly, they are surrounded on all sides, not by some Men of the Black Clan, but all of them. Hundreds. Watching silently. Waiting...ANGLE ON: Mariko coming to, seeing her father over Logan, ready to behead him. She looks around, sees a dagger in the grass. She grabs it. Meanwhile: SHINGEN (CONTD)In the end, Logan-san ... you were worthy. MARIKOFather-He turns, catching  Marikos hand before she can stab him. She twists her wrist and shakes the dagger from her grasp. Then he shoves her back. He turns quickly to finish the job, taking the sword in both hands...AND NOTICES A SMALL CUT ON THE BACK OF HIS HAND - superficial really - between his thumb and forefinger. A trace of pale green. He sees the green dagger in the grass. The dagger Mariko was holding.His hand trembles, convulses. The skin blisters and bubbles. The bubbles crawl up his arm, under his robe. He drops his sword, puts a hand to his throat as his blood boils. As his eyes turn bright red. And Shingen collapses. Dead. 120.'b'Mariko rushes to Logan as Yukio comes to. She crawls over to Viper, lying face down on the ground. Yukio rolls her over. Viper has fallen on her own knife. Mariko helps Logan to his feet as his wounds slowly heal. Meanwhile The Black Clan slowly gathers around him. As always, without a sound.At the front of the mass of assassins is the Monk. He kneels before Logan and the others do the same. It is a solemn moment. SAMURAI(through bitter tears)You have been chosen. You are Master of the Black Clan.LOGANBut... I didnt kill him.(to the Monk)I didnt kill Shingen. Mariko did. No winner, no master.The Monk just bows solemnly, waiting.SAMURAIYou have been chosen, Logan. They await your command.LOGANNo. I dont want this. I didnt ask for it.YUKIOThen dont give them a command. What difference does it make.LOGAN(re: Shingen and Samurai)Look at them. Therell always be a challenger. Ill be the one who has to kill them. One day, one of them will win. Maybe someone even worse than Shingen. No. I wont do it.(to Yukio)Take Mariko. Get her out of here. Mariko holds on to him.MARIKOWhat about you?LOGANIm gonna deal with them. 121.'b'Mariko sees too many killers to count. Logan and the Monk share a look, an understanding between warriors.MARIKONo. Logan, please. LOGANTheyre a curse, Mariko. Theyve beena cruse on your people for two thousand years. It ends tonight. MARIKOLogan-LOGANDo as I say. Please. Go.Mariko knows there is no convincing Logan. Yukio takes her by the arm and leads her away.MARIKIOS P.O.V.of Logan standing at the center of an army of Assassins, who live only to kill. Samurai rocks gently on his knees a few feet away, clutching whats left of his arm his instrument. ANGLE ON: Logan and the Monk, staring at one another. The Monk seems to read Logans mind. The Monk nods. INT. YASHIDA STRONGHOLD - NIGHTMariko and Yukio are crossing the grand entrance, headed for the front door when a sound O.S. stopsthem in their tracks - countless voices screaming at once. A war-cry to chill the blood. MARIKOLOGAN.And then silence. Marikos eyes fill with tears. Yukio cannot hide her sympathy. They share a look of deep sadness and walk out.  EXT. YASHIDA STRONGHOLD - DRIVEWAY - NIGHTMariko helps Yukio into the car and shuts the door, walking around to the other side. She gasps: ANGLE ON: Logan, standing in the doorway of the stronghold, not a scratch on him. He walks toward Mariko. She runs to him. They embrace. Then: 122.'b'MARIKOWhat did you do? LOGANIm Master of the Black Clan. I spoke. They obeyed.MARIKOWhat did you say?LOGAN... Seppuku.EXT. YASHIDA STRONGHOLD - GARDEN - NIGHTThe ground is littered with bodies - Assassins in black lie everywhere, each man with a sword in his chest. Each man dead by his own hand. At the center of it sits Silver Samurai, Kenuichio. He takes in the bodies of the men hed hoped to lead, the father hed hoped to honor and the woman hed been seduced into serving, all dead...And he sobs as though he might never stop.CLOSE ON: A green bladed dagger in the grass... waiting to be found.

Logan is still a wanted man.The low bellow of a ships horn takes us to: EXT. TOKYO WATERFRONT - NIGHTLogan, Sinatra and Yukio stand at the bottom of a gangway to a massive cargo ship in a dense fog. 123.'b'Logan is anxious. The ships horn blasts. Sinatra checks his watch. SINATRAIts time. LOGANWhere is she?The ships horn blasts again. SINATRALogan.Just then the headlights of an approaching car slice the dense fog. Logan sighs, walks toward it as a lone figure gets out. Logan is confused when he sees: LOGANZen...Hes looking a little worse for wear but well enough.ZENApologies for the delay. I wanted to be here to say goodbye.Logan is touched. Another figure emerges from the fog: Mariko, as stunning as ever. He extends a hand: LOGANShips leaving, come on. MARIKOIm not going.Stunned pause. Zen bends his head. Yukio and Sinatra share a look. LOGANMariko- MARIKOI am the sole heir of my family. I have a duty. A responsibility. I cannot go... And you cannot stay. (touching his cheek)Perhaps one day... when I can make people see the truth...But thats a long way off. She kisses him gently: 124.'b'MARIKO (CONTD)I will never forget you. I will never forget what you have done for my family. For this country. He just stares at her, the pain in his eyes is too much for her. Her eyes fill with tears: MARIKO (CONTD)Dream of me, Kuzuri.And despite himself, despite his pain, Logan wipes the look away and says the only thing he can: LOGANGoodbye, Mariko. They kiss again. Yukio looks away. Sinatra puts a comforting hand on her shoulder. Mariko turns and walks back to the car, wiping tears from her eyes as the fog swallows her. Logan turns to Zen who holds a familiar object in the hands. THE BOX left to him by Yashida. The box containing the mystery of his identity. ZENThe answers you seek.Logan mumbles something inaudible.ZEN (CONTD)What?LOGANHe said honor the gift I was given. The Old Man saved my life. I repaid him by killing his son.(re: box)I havent earned this Zen.ZENAfter all this time, you still dont understand... Inside that box are the answers to all of your questions... Except the answer to the only question that truly matters. LOGAN Which is? 125.'b'ZENWhat happens now?(pointing to the box)Honor the gift you were given. Logan looks at the box and realizes: LOGAN What was done to me.. What I am. ZENIs a blessing. Not a curse.LOGANIt doesnt matter how I came to be what I am... It only matters what I do with it. ZEN(smiles/nods)The lesson has ended. As if on cue, the ships horn blows again.SINATRALogan, you have to go.LOGANGoodbye, Zen.ZENI will say... Until we meet again. Zen smiles, bows, and leaves. Logan heads for the gangway. Yukio tries to not run after him. She tries not to get in his way. But shes Yukio. She runs, blocking his path, standing on to the bottom of the step of the gangway as it slowly rises. YUKIOYou would leave me without a master?LOGANIts time to be on your own. Perhaps for the first time in her life, Yukio is speechless, considering the unthinkable. Logan takes her hand, easing her off the gangway and stepping on. LOGAN (CONTD)And who knows... You might even end up the one in charge. 126.'b'He says this wit ha nod to Sinatra, waiting anxiously  for Logan to leave. And Yukio to stay. YUKIORemember me, Logan-sama.LOGANHow could I possibly forget? She smiles. Logan smiles back. Then they lose one another in the fog...EXT. PACIFIC OCEAN - NIGHTMOVING SWIFTLY over dark water turning white. We are in the wake of a ship, heading to sea.We spy something in the water and slow to take a look. A single sheet of yellowed parchment, floating on the surface, slowly dissolving, the words no longer legible. No longer important. We move on, finding more pages - hundreds of them - the story of a man being untold, forgotten. And then we reach the beginning...A MASSIVE FREIGHTER, the YASHIDA MARV, leads toward a fog-bank over calm seas, horizon unseen. We find a man in battered leather on the stern, smoking a cigar, looking back at the fading lights of Tokyo, shrouded in mist, like a vague memory.The man holds a box in his hands. The box with the answers to the riddle of his past. But his past doesnt matter anymore.

The underside of the panels house a variety of hand-built ASTRONOMICAL DEVICES, which now point at the sky. JANE FOSTER (late 20\'s) pops her head through the roof. She positions a MAGNETOMETER, so its monitor calibrates with the constellations above. It appears to be cobbled together from spare parts of other devices.JANEHurry!We hear a loud BANG followed by muffled CURSING from below.

ODIN'S CHAMBERS - DAY 16 16 16Odin turns away from the window. His wife FRIGGA sits at a vanity and tries different earrings before the mirror.ODINDo you think he's ready?FRIGGAHe thinks he is. He has his father's confidence.ODINHe'll need his father's wisdom.FRIGGAAnd his humility? Odin reacts.FRIGGA (CONT'D)Thor won't be alone. Loki will be at his side to give him counsel. Have faith in your sons.ODINYes, but Thor's still a boy. He could be a great King... Odin stops, notices HIS HAND SHAKING. It seems to be out of synch temporally with the rest of the world, leaving a trail as it moves. He stares at it determinedly, concentrating, trying to stop the strange event through the force of his sheer will.Finally, the occurrence subsides, his hand normal once more. A worried Frigga covers his hand with her own.ODIN (CONT'D)(QUIETLY)...if we only had more time.FRIGGAFor once, our son needs something we cannot provide.9."b"ODINI can fight it a little longer...FRIGGANo. You've put it off too long!

Now come kiss your king... while I'm still king. He pulls her close, and they kiss.INT. PALACE ANTEROOM - DAY 17 17 17Directly under the throne room, a gloomily lit hall. Banners hang on either side to form a corridor down the middle of the fire lit room. Giant doors open at one end. A huge figure silhouetted against the bright light beyond walks forward. In slo-mo, we recognize the unmistakable shape of the God of Thunder. Hammer in hand, he reaches the end of a raised platform. An ATTENDANT hands the figure a goblet of wine. He downs it quickly, hurls it towards the fire directly below.THORAnother!The cup smashes, the alcohol causes the fire to glow intensely -- and, for a moment, brightly lit, and seen full length, like a King to be, is THE MIGHTY THOR. He proceeds down stops, past camera, and down the center of the Hall. We follow from behind and see at the other end, massively shadowed on one of the great banners, the shape of two great horns. As Thor approaches, the horn shapes move, and then, from the shadows at the side, emerges LOKI, wearing his horned headpiece. Like Thor, he is dressed for a great ceremony. They stand by a brazier at the foot of steps that lead up to the crowded throne room.LOKI(TO THOR)Nervous, brother?10."b"THORHave you ever known me to be nervous?LOKIThere was the time in Nornheim...THORThat wasn't nerves, brother. It was the rage of battle. How else could I have fought my way through a hundred warriors and pulled us out alive?The Attendant approaches with another goblet of wine for Thor.LOKIAs I recall, I was the one who veiled us in smoke to ease our escape.THORSome do battle, others just do tricks.The Attendant stifles a laugh. Loki notices, doesn't like it. He gestures towards the goblet in the Attendant's hand. EELS pour over the sides of the goblet, slithering out and across the terrified Attendant's hand. He SCREAMS, hurls the goblet to the ground. Loki chuckles.THOR (CONT'D)Loki...Loki gestures to the writhing eels on the ground. They turn back to spilled wine, the illusion shattered.THOR (CONT'D)Now that was just a waste of good wine.LOKIJust a bit of fun.(to the Attendant)Right, my friend? The Attendant isn't so sure. Thor dons his EAGLE-WINGEDHELMET.LOKI(re: Thor's helmet)Nice feathers.11."b"THORYou don't really want to start this again, do you, Cow?LOKII was being sincere!THORYou're incapable of sincerity.LOKIAm I?He looks his brother in the eye, all pretense lost.LOKI (CONT'D)I've looked forward to this day as long as you have. You're my brother and my friend. Sometimes I'm envious, but never doubt that I love you.Thor searches his brother's face, sees no trace of irony. He's either speaking from his heart or he's a very, very good liar. Maybe both. Thor puts an appreciative hand on his brother's shoulder.THORThank you.The two brothers take in the moment a beat, then:LOKIGive us a kiss.THORStop.Thor makes the final adjustments to his ceremonial wear.THOR (CONT'D)How do I look?LOKILike a king.They hear the blast of a CEREMONIAL HORN.LOKI (CONT'D)It's time.THORYou go ahead.12."b"Loki casts him a wary look.THOR (CONT'D)I'll be along. Go on. Loki heads inside the palace without his brother.INT. ANTECHAMBER - NIGHT 17A 17A 17AVOLSTAGG combs his great beard in preparation for the big event. As he does, he's surprised to find a stray GRAPE stuck in the beard. He pulls it out, looks around, then eagerly pops it into his mouth and gobbles it down. FANDRAL checks his reflection in a mirror, smooths out his moustache, gives himself a dashing smile. A PRETTY MAIDEN holds the mirror before him, as other MAIDENS look on dreamily.FANDRALThank you, love.(to the Maidens)FANDRAL (CONT'D)Now who'd like to polish my sword for me?The giddy Maidens eagerly raise their hands. HOGUN stands staring ahead grimly, his hands folded in front of him, amidst the hustle and bustle of the ATTENDANTS and the ceremony preparations going on around him. A HELPFUL ATTENDANT approaches him and starts to polish his armor. Hogun turns his head, gives him a look. Intimidated, the Attendant quickly backs away. From behind, we see a WOMAN IN CEREMONIAL ARMOR take off her SWORD and set it on a table, then her SHIELD, then several HIDDEN DAGGERS and small, yet intimidating WEAPONS. We reveal that it's SIF, looking radiant. She eyes the weapons on the table.SIF(to the weapons)I'll miss you.INT. THRONE ROOM - DAY 18 18 18Colorful CEREMONIAL BANNERS of the Nine Realms adorn the room, crowded with AESIR and REPRESENTATIVES from across Yggdrasil, all BUZZING with excitement. Thor's COMRADES enter and stride to their place of honor at the front of the hall. They are:THE WARRIORS THREEVOLSTAGG has the girth and strength of a Sumo wrestler, with oversized passions to match. 13."b"FANDRAL, the consummate swashbuckler, is agile, charismatic, and nattily dressed. HOGUN -- dark, sullen, brooding -- a large MACE slung at his side. With them walks the warrior maiden SIF. She's clad in armor, a shield and sword at her side -- a beauty not to be trifled with.VOLSTAGGI hope this goes quickly. I'm famished.FANDRAL(FEIGNED DISBELIEF)Noooo!VOLSTAGGAre you attached to that pretty face of yours? Because one more word, and you won't be.FANDRAL(to the others)My, we are hungry, aren't we? The others laugh, save Hogun. Fandral turns to him.FANDRAL (CONT'D)Go on, Hogun. Smile. You can do it. Even you, Hogun the Grim. Just one smile.Hogun stares at him grimly.FANDRAL (CONT'D)All right, half a smile.

PALACE ANTEROOM - DAY 19A 19A 19AThor stands, his fingers nervously drumming the handle of his hammer. Frigga approaches behind him, sees his anxiety.FRIGGAIt's all right to be nervous.THORWhy does everyone keep saying that? I'm not nervous!FRIGGAYou may be able to fool the rest ofASGARD --THOR...but never you. I know.FRIGGAThor, just remember that you have something even the great Allfather never had.THORAnd what is that?FRIGGAMe for a mother. She smiles.FRIGGA (CONT'D)Now don't keep your father waiting. Frigga leaves.INT. THRONE ROOM - DAY 20 20 20Sif and the Warriors Three still wait before the crowd. Loki and Frigga enter. Loki takes his place at the front of the hall alongside the others. With another blast of the horn, the crowd goes silent as the EINHERJAR HONOR GUARD moves into formation. They part to reveal --ODINSitting atop his throne, clad in full ceremonial armor. He holds his spear GUNGNIR before him. Any trace of weakness in him is gone now. He exudes all the power and majesty of a Ruler of Asgard. Frigga joins him at his side. He looks around the hall, casts a glance over to the Warriors. Thor is nowhere to be seen. Odin looks to Loki. (MORE)15."b"Loki shrugs. Odin isn't pleased. A murmur spreads through the crowd.VOLSTAGG(sotto, to Loki)Where is he?LOKIHe said he'd be along. Sif realizes the truth, shakes her head in disapproval.VOLSTAGGWhat?SIFHe wants to make an entrance.FANDRALWell, if he doesn't show up soon, he shouldn't bother. Odin looks like he's ready to feed him to his ravens.LOKII wouldn't worry. Father will forgive him. He always does.Just then, at the back of the hall, up the steps from the lower level --MJOLNIRRoars up into the hall, Thor strides cockily into the hall behind it, catching it behind his back. The CROWD erupts in CHEERS. Thor spins his hammer with a flourish, holds it up before the crowd, basking in the moment, relishing the adoration, whipping his audience up into a frenzy.SIFOh, please.Odin watches from the front, not liking this showy display.INT. VAULT - DAY 21 21 21As the sound of the cheers echo from above, the odd, cold breeze picks up in the Vault. The Guards rub their limbs to warm themselves. They grow increasingly uneasy, sensing something's not right. ODIN (CONT'D)16."b"They exchange a look, then walk the length of the Vault's hallway to its end, where a CASKET sits undisturbed upon a pedestal. LARGE SHADOWS suddenly loom over them. They look up and SHOUT in terror as they raise their weapons.INT. THRONE ROOM - DAY 22 22 22Thor finishes stirring up the crowd, then reaches the front of the room, kneels on one knee before his mother and father. Frigga casts him an admonishing glance. Thor winks up at her. She can't help but smile. Odin strikes Gungnir upon the ground with a deafening BOOM. The crowd falls silent. Odin speaks with quiet, effortless authority. He raises Gungnir before him.ODINGungnir. Its aim is true, its power strong. With it I have defended Asgard and the lives of the innocent across the Nine Realms since the time of the Great Beginning. And though the day has come for a new King to wield his own weapon -- that duty remains the same. Thor Odinson, my heir, my first-born.ODIN (CONT'D)So long entrusted with this mighty hammer, Mjolnir. Forged in the heart of a dying star, from the sacred metal of Uru. Only one may lift it. Only one is worthy. Who wields this hammer commands the lightning and the storm. Its power has no equal -- as a weapon, to destroy, or as a tool, to build. It is a fit companion for a King.INT. VAULT - DAY 23 23 23The bodies of the Guards are flung to the Vault's floor, now strewn with ice. We don't see their attackers clearly, just catch glimpses of them in the shadows -- but they are large and BLUE-SKINNED. One of the creatures lifts the Casket off its stand and turns to go. But, as they do, the intricate latticework behind the Casket starts to separate and retract, revealing something standing in the shadows behind it. As the creatures walk away, a fiery glow rises behind them. They turn back around. Now it's their turn to SCREAM.INT. THRONE ROOM - DAY 24 24 24The Ceremony continues.17."b"ODINToday I entrust you with the greatest honor in all the Nine Realms. The sacred throne of Asgard. I have sacrificed much to achieve peace. So, too, must a new generation sacrifice to maintain that peace. Responsibility, duty, honor. These are not merely virtues to which we must aspire. They are essential to every soldier and to every King. The Crowd and the Warriors Three start to shiver and rub their limbs for warmth in the increasingly cold air of the hall.Thor turns back to face his father. Odin looks upon his son with pride.ODIN (CONT'D)Thor Odinson, do you swear to guard the Nine Realms?THORI swear.ODINDo you swear to preserve the peace?THORI swear.ODINDo you swear to cast aside all selfish ambition and pledge yourself only to the good of all the Realms?Beat.THORI swear.ODINThen on this day, I, Odin Allfather, proclaim you-- Odin hesitates, noticing a strange sight before him. ICE creeps across the surface of the large banners around the hall, making an eerie CRACKING sound. Thor, his comrades, and the crowd see it too.18."b"ODIN (CONT'D)(REALIZING)Frost giants...The far-off sounds of a BATTLE echo in the depths of the palace below.

VAULT - DAY 25B 25B 25BThor enters, then stares shocked at the sight before him. Sif, the Warriors Three, and Loki hurry in behind Thor and stop short. Shattered and melting ICE is strewn about the floor. We don't see the blue-skinned bodies of the Frost Giants clearly, just catch glimpses of their twisted and smoldering remains on the floor. They've just lost a savage battle. Badly. Amidst them, shrouded in shadow, stands the black metal creature, a fiery glow coming from within it. It is THE DESTROYER. It holds the Casket in its hands.SIFThe Destroyer.VOLSTAGG(AWED)I thought it was but a legend. Odin steps in behind the Asgardians, as the Destroyer sets the Casket back on its pedestal. It moves back to its post, the faint, FIERY GLOW extinguishes within it. Fandral looks around the Vault, ill at ease.FANDRALI've never been inside the Vault before. It's said the Tesseract was once held here.VOLSTAGG(AWED)The Tesseract? I thought that was but a legend too!SIFShush!Odin surveys the destruction.19."b'THORThe Jotuns must pay for what they\'ve done!ODINThey have paid with their lives.

He backs away, then leaves, pushing through the doors so hard that they SLAM backwards behind him. Odin watches him go.INT. BANQUET HALL - DAY 26 26 26Thor stands in the empty hall, bearing the signs of the festivities cancelled due to the events of the day. Anger and frustration rising within him, Thor upends one of the massive tables. From across the room, Loki watches him.AT THE BANQUET HALL ENTRANCESif, Fandral, and Hogun follow Volstagg as he enters in search of his dinner.SIFRedecorating, are we? Volstagg surveys the overturned tables and food, aghast.21."b"VOLSTAGGWhat's this -- ?!HOGUNI told you they'd cancel it.FANDRALWe thought that was just you being your normal cheery self. Volstagg looks about the floor, despairing.VOLSTAGGAll this food -- so innocent, cast to the ground. It breaks the heart!Thor strides away from them to the far end of the hall. Loki calmly moves towards him.THORIt's unwise to be in my company right now, brother.LOKIWho said I was wise?THOR(re: the empty hall)This was to be my day of triumph.LOKIIt will come. In time.(ADMITS)If it's any consolation, I think you're right. About the Frost Giants, about Laufey, everything. If a few of them could penetrate the defenses of Asgard once, who's to say they won't try again. Next time with an army?THORYes, exactly!LOKIBut there's nothing we can do without defying Father. Thor considers this, looks at his hammer, a gleam in his eye. Loki can guess what he's thinking, grows concerned.LOKI (CONT'D)No... stop there!

ODIN'S PALACE - DAY 27 27 27Thor, Sif, Loki, and the Warriors Three walk from the Palace, across the grounds. They reach a group of ATTENDANTS who ready their battle gear for their journey. Loki slips away from the group, speaks to a nearby GUARD. Hogun notices.THORWe must first find a way to get past Heimdall.VOLSTAGGThat will be no easy task. It's said the Gatekeeper can see a single dew drop fall from a blade of grass a thousand worlds away.FANDRALAnd he can hear a cricket passing gas in Niffelheim.VOLSTAGGJest not!

GATE OF ASGARD - DAY 28 28 28Thor and his band of adventurers, on horseback, pass through the massive Gate, leaving Asgard behind. They ride along the most astounding path in this Realm or any other --THE RAINBOW BRIDGE.Wide and flat, it runs straight out from Odin's palace to the mists and black void of space beyond. In the distance far ahead, the Bridge continues on until it reaches Heimdall's Observatory.EXT. HEIMDALL'S OBSERVATORY - DAY 29 29 29The band draws near the Observatory, where HEIMDALL himself, Gatekeeper of Asgard, stands at his post on the Bridge before them, blocking their way, staring them down. There is something other-worldly about him, even for this Realm. He holds a massive sword in front of him, his stern, intimidating face virtually concealed by armor. Something glints beneath his visor, like twinkling stars.LOKIKeep your weapons sheathed and your mouths closed. This is going to take subtlety and sincerity, not brute strength. Leave it to me. Loki dismounts and steps forward.LOKI (CONT'D)GOOD HEIMDALL--HEIMDALLYou're not dressed warmly enough. Thor, Loki, and the others trade looks.LOKII'm sorry?HEIMDALLThe freezing cold of Jotunheim. It will kill you all in time, even Thor.(THEN)You think you can deceive me? I, who watch all? (MORE)26."b"I, who can sense the flapping of a butterfly's wings a thousand worlds away?

We're not--THOR(STEPPING FORWARD)Enough.(TO HEIMDALL)Heimdall, may we pass? Heimdall stares him down.HEIMDALLFor ages have I guarded Asgard and kept it safe from those who would do it harm. In all that time, never has an enemy slipped by my watch -- until this day. I wish to know how that happened.THORThen tell no one where we've gone until we've returned. Thor walks past Heimdall as the Gatekeeper lets the group pass. Volstagg walks beside the frustrated Loki, needles him.VOLSTAGGWhat happened?

HEIMDALL'S OBSERVATORY - DAY 30 30 30Thor and the others enter the Observatory, step onto a platform. Heimdall climbs into the large control apparatus at the center of the room and readies the Observatory.HEIMDALLBe warned. I will honor my sworn oath to protect this Realm as its Gatekeeper. If your return threatens the safety of Asgard, Bifrost will remain closed to you. You'll be left to die in the cold wastes of Jotunheim.THORI have no plans to die today.HEIMDALLNone do.Heimdall inserts his sword into the control panel, and the apparatus of the Observatory starts up.EXT.

The Observatory's giant turret swings around, aims toward a section of space. As a final step, Heimdall plunges his sword deeper into the control panel. The great turret FIRES, the RAINBOW LIGHT of Bifrost energy blasts out of it. The Bifrost opens at the end of the platform upon which Thor and his five comrades stand.HEIMDALLAll is ready.

Never mind, then. Thor starts towards the Bifrost, turns back to the others, grins.THORCome on. Don't be bashful. The others join him at his side, then step towards the Bifrost.

In an instant, they're jerked off the platform and inside the vortex.EXT. BIFROST LANDING SITE (JOTUNHEIM) - DAY 33 33 33A hole in the sky rips open, and the Bifrost comes shooting out of it. Snow flurries up when the Bifrost hits, as Thor and his band touch down. RUNES from the Bifrost are imprinted on the ice around them.Volstagg loses his footing, falling backwards. Thor quickly grabs him by the belt. We see the warrior dangling precariously on the edge of a sheer cliff on the planet's inner ring, opening up to the black abyss of space beyond.THORCome on, big fella. Up...! With an effort, Thor pulls the burly warrior back onto the ice and, tremendously relieved, he proclaims:VOLSTAGGThis belt! This belt is now my lucky belt! I will never remove it! Even when bathing!FANDRALYou bathe?Thor and the others turn and stare out in horror and wonder at the frozen alien wasteland before them. The whole planet is a massive flattened ring of jagged ice, slowly breaking apart. Huge CHUNKS OF ICE calve away from its outer edges and float off into space. The planet's icy surface cracks and melts as far as the eye can see. The ruins of a Jotun city lies in the distance.HOGUNWe shouldn't be here.29."b"THORToo late now.FANDRALActually, it's not.

She and Thor share a grin. The party reaches the edge of the city -- its ancient structures of jade and ice melting and crumbling, ravaged by warfare long ago. A TEMPLE lies before them, across a central plaza.SIF (CONT'D)Where are they?THORHiding. As cowards always do. Thor leads the others onwards towards the central plaza. Loki reluctantly follows. They don't notice as SHADOWY FIGURES move in the shadows of the structures nearby.EXT. CENTRAL PLAZA - DAY 35 35 35The party reaches the plaza. They sense the Frost Giants in the shadows and crevices, surrounding them now on all sides. 31."b'The Asgardians reach for the hilts of their weapons. A JOTUN SENTRY calls to him.JOTUN SENTRYWhat is your business here, Asgardian?The Jotun\'s voice itself sounds like cracking ice.THORI speak only to your King. Not to his foot soldiers.JOTUN VOICE (O.S.)Then speak.Thor turns towards the source in a balcony of the temple, where LAUFEY sits, veiled in shadow, behind a cascading waterfall. The Jotun King is ancient, noble, powerful -- too proud to reveal even a hint of the years of suffering he and his people have endured.LAUFEYI am Laufey, King of this Realm.THORAnd I am--LAUFEYWe know who you are, Odinson.

Nothing but a boy, trying to prove himself a man.THORThis boy has grown tired of your mockery.Thor takes a step towards Laufey. The other Jotuns step in front of Thor, blocking his path.

He knows what\'s coming.LOKIDamn.In one quick move, Thor pulls Mjolnir, swings it, and KNOCKS the Jotun clear across the plaza.

One Giant does so directly in front of Fandral.FANDRALI\'m hoping that\'s just decorative. Thor leaves the circle of Asgardians, swings at another Frost Giant. His comrades form another circle around him, separating him from the Jotuns, as he whirls his hammer around once and catches it with a cocky grin. He\'s enjoying this.THORNext!Fandral calls to Volstagg and Hogun.FANDRALWell? What move, do you think?VOLSTAGGI say we use "The Norn\'s Revenge."\xc2\xac\xb934.'b'FANDRALAt this close range? I think "The Alfheim Lunge"\xc2\xac\xb9 is a better move.VOLSTAGG(DISGUSTED)Maybe if they were three feet tall! No! How about "The Randy Valkyrie"\xc2\xac\xb9?HOGUNShut up!Thor takes out yet another Frost Giant, then all hell breaks loose as the Asgardians and Jotuns begin to battle. A Jotun backs Hogun up against a wall of ice. As the Giant hurls an ice blade fist at him, the grim warrior swings his mace over his head, embedding it into the ice wall, and hoists himself up, dodging the Giant\'s blow and leaping over him. Hogun takes out a second approaching Frost Giant, spins back, dodges a swing from the first, then pounds the Jotun with his mace. Nearby, Sif expertly stabs one Jotun after another with her double-bladed staff. One knocks her viciously to the ground.SIFIf you don\'t treat me like a lady, I won\'t act like a lady! She takes out the Jotun. Loki backs away from an approaching Jotun, finds himself at the edge of a deep crevasse. The Giant sees he\'s vulnerable, swipes at him. But the Jotun\'s arm passes right through him. The Giant stands there, confused, when THE REAL LOKI comes out from behind a structure and shoves the Giant into the crevasse below. The false Loki dissipates into nothingness.LOKI(to the falling Giant)Pathetic.He turns back to the battle. Two Jotuns come at him from either side. He lets two daggers fly, felling both Giants at once. Laufey nods to one of his guards -- a massive Jotun BRUTE. The Brute leaps down from the balcony, icing himself up, then punches his giant fist into the ice beneath his feet. It\'s a long-range attack, causing PILLARS OF ICE to explode out in front of Hogun, sending the grim warrior flying back. Across the plaza, Thor easily dispatches some Jotuns.35.'b"THORCome on! At least make it a challenge for me! He sees the Brute coming at him. The huge Jotun lands a tremendous blow, sending Thor back across the ice. Thor rises, grins.THOR (CONT'D)Now that's more like it! He throws Mjolnir with all his strength, knocking the Brute head over heels. Thor raises his hand. Mjolnir slows in mid-air, then flies back to his grasp.THOR (CONT'D)(re: the fallen Brute)Ugly and stupid. Sif takes out a couple Frost Giants, but she's knocked to the ground by another. It raises its weapon above her. Hogun sees Sif in danger. He pulls a HIDDEN KNIFE from his sleeve and hurls it at Sif's attacker, hitting him square in the chest. The Jotun falls dead.SIF(to Hogun, re: knife)I'm so glad I taught him how to do that!Volstagg grapples with a Frost Giant, getting a couple good hits in.VOLSTAGGYou may want to put some ice on that!The Frost Giant fights back, but Volstagg manages to grip in a headlock just as another comes up on him from behind. Volstagg fends him off, then turns the first one loose.VOLSTAGG (CONT'D)You may be taller, but I'm wider! Volstagg launches his mighty belly at the Jotun and sends him flying.Another Jotun grabs Volstagg, squeezing him tightly and sending him crashing to the ground.36."b"VOLSTAGG (CONT'D)It's not too late for you to surrender.Volstagg recovers and fights on. The Jotun grabs Volstagg's bare arm. The warrior's skin begins to freeze from the Jotun's grasp, a BLACKNESS spreading from it, necrotizing Volstagg's flesh. The warrior SHOUTS in pain.Volstagg head-butts the Frost Giant, shattering the Jotun's ice helmet and dropping him to the ground. Winded, he takes a seat upon one of the fallen Jotun's bodies to catch his breath. As the battle rages around him, he opens a secret compartment at the end of his weapon, takes out a small FLASK. Volstagg grimaces in pain, sees his blackened skin. He yells to his comrades.VOLSTAGG (CONT'D)Don't let them grab hold of you! He takes a swig, enjoying the brief respite, then rejoins the battle.Volstagg stabs his blade in a Giant's chest, but the sword stops mid ice layer. The Giant delivers a bone-breaking blow to Volstagg's face, and the warrior drops to one knee. Sif sees Volstagg in trouble and rushes towards him. In one quick move, she leaps up and off of Volstagg's back, using her boot to plunge Volstagg's blade deep into the Giant's chest, standing atop him as he falls backwards to the ground.VOLSTAGG (CONT'D)(on his belly)Thank you, my lady. But I nearly had him!SIFOf course you did. Nearby, a Frost Giant forms a BARRAGE OF ICE BULLETS, hurling them at Sif. Sif raises her shield barely in time, as the bullets go pinging and ricocheting off it. She races into the group of Frost Giants who attacked her and takes them out.A Frost Giant touches a pool of standing water. It FLASH- FREEZES Hogun's feet to the ground. Volstagg notices, hurries over, dispatching Jotuns as he goes.VOLSTAGGHang on!37."b"Volstagg swings his weapon, wildly hacking at the ice around Hogun's legs to free him. Hogun looks down, suddenly worried, as Volstagg's blade cuts deep -- and perilously close to hacking into Hogun's legs.HOGUNWatch the legs!VOLSTAGG(REALIZING)Right. Sorry.Volstagg chips away at the ice more carefully, finally freeing Hogun's feet. Fandral sword fights with a Frost Giant.FANDRALYou really think your icicles are a match for Asgardian steel? Fandral lunges at the Giant. The Jotun knocks his blade away.FANDRAL (CONT'D)Fair enough.Fandral moves on him again, but the Giant grabs Fandral's sword and snaps it in half.FANDRAL (CONT'D)Could we stop just a moment while I get another sword? Fandral fights the Giant with his broken sword. The Jotun then lunges at Fandral, who ducks just in time, grabs hold of the Giant's sword and redirects it, stabbing the Giant through with his own weapon. The Jotun staggers back, then reaches down and swipes at a pool of water, sending up a spray that freezes in mid-air, forming into an ICE STALAGMITE. It impales Fandral, rendering him helpless.Loki races towards the impaled Fandral, throwing daggers and felling Frost Giants as he goes. He reaches the nearly- unconscious warrior, when other Jotuns approach. He fights them off. Volstagg looks across the plaza and sees the impaled Fandral.VOLSTAGGThat's unfortunate. He hurries to his wounded comrade.38."b"FANDRALI may need a bit of help. Not a good look, is it?VOLSTAGGJust try not to bleed.FANDRALHow's the face?VOLSTAGGFlawless.Volstagg begins to pull the bleeding Fandral off the ice stalagmite. Loki plunges two daggers into the chest of one of the Frost Giants. The Giant grabs hold of Loki's gloved wrists. Loki pulls his hands free of the gloves, which are still in the Giant's grasp, revealing Loki's skin beneath. The wounded Jotun sees his chance, grabs hold of Loki's bare arm. Loki looks at his arm, prepared for the worst. But instead of the blackness of necrotizing flesh, Loki's arm turns BLUE -- like the Frost Giant's own skin. The blueness spreads painlessly up Loki's arm. He stares at it, confused. The Frost Giant is thrown as well, distracted by the unexpected phenomenon. Loki takes advantage of the distraction, KICKS the Giant.Thor continues fighting, his blood lust rising. He taunts the Jotuns around him.THORCome on!But when he hurls his hammer to take out a Jotun, the Frost Giants seize the opportunity. A group of Jotuns swarm Thor from all sides, keeping him separate from his weapon. Mjolnir falls to the ground. A Frost Giant desperately struggles to lift Mjolnir off the ground, to no avail. Now free, the wounded Fandral looks relieved as Volstagg slings him over his shoulder, and the warriors start to leave. From his balcony, Laufey looks upon the battlefield, decides it's time to pull out the big guns. He touches a wall of the palace. An ENERGY WAVE sweeps from his touch, across the wall of the palace, and down to the ground below. The Asgardians hear a foreboding CRACK OF ICE below their feet.LOKIThat can't be good.VOLSTAGGYes, it could! Might be an early spring!39."b"They look down, suddenly filled with dread when they see shadowy figures moving in the ice -- dozens of JOTUN WARRIORS awakening beneath the surface, rousing to join the battle. Loki turns to his brother, who battles a group of the Giants.LOKIThor, we must go! Thor, still without his hammer, fights his Jotun foes mercilessly, a man consumed by blood lust. Loki sees the look on his brother's face -- the savage thrill of the heat of battle.THORThen go!SIFThere are too many of them!THORI can stop them! The others hesitate. Jotuns break up through the ice all around them.SIFThor!But Thor ignores his comrades, continues fighting.VOLSTAGGRun!Reluctantly, the group flees back toward the inner edge of the planet as the Giants break up through the ice and give chase. Thor battles valiantly, but there's just too many of them. The Frost Giants swarm him from all sides now, as he disappears beneath a pile of blue flesh and ice. After aMOMENT --THOR'S FISTForces its way up through the middle of the pile of Jotuns. He opens his hand, beckoning. One of Thor's attackers hears something ROARING up behind him. He whirls around -- BAM! -- Mjolnir nails him square in the face, then flies into Thor's outstretched hand. Thor raises the hammer up high, and brings it down on the ground with all his might. KRAKABOOM! (MORE)40."b"Lightning strikes down from the sky, the hammer channeling the blast, firing the electricity out at the Jotuns around him. They're blasted back in a massive shockwave. The Jotuns convulse, drop dead to the ground.But the force of the blast also cracks the ice below, the shockwave continuing to spread outwards. It moves out to where his comrades are running, breaking up the ground beneath them, exposing the black void of space below.VOLSTAGGWhat's Thor done?LOKILikely killed us all! As the Jotuns race towards the Asgardians, they open their mouths wide and breathe out an ICY FOG. The swirling mists quickly engulf the fleeing Asgardians before them. The Asgardians stand in the mist, unable to see. Hogun takes a step back, the ice cracking beneath him. They dare not move, for fear of falling through, into the void below. Thor sees he's put his friends in even greater danger. He raises Mjolnir high, SUMMONING THE WINDS. They lift him off the ground and carry him across the frozen wasteland to his comrades.EXT. BIFROST LANDING SITE (JOTUNHEIM) - DAY 35A 35A 35AThor lands beside his comrades in the shroud of mists.THORLoki, we have to see. Loki raises his arms, concentrates, the mists dissipating. But as they do, the Asgardians see before them the faces of the Frost Giants. And there are HUNDREDS of them -- too many, even for a Thunder God.VOLSTAGG(TO LOKI)Actually, could you bring the mists back, please?THOR'S FIST (CONT'D)41."b"Thor realizes that he and his comrades are as good as dead. The Giants move in for the kill, when they hear a deafening ROAR. A hole in the sky opens up, and the Bifrost blasts down onto the inner edge of the planet. Out of the maelstrom comes the sound of THUNDERING HOOVES, and, to the shock of all, tearing across the frozen wasteland comes --ODIN ALLFATHERAstride his powerful, eight-legged steed SLEIPNIR. He's clad in battle armor, Gungnir in his hand -- an imposing sight.The Giants part in fear as he thunders into their ranks, stopping before Laufey and the Asgardians. Laufey slams his fists into the ground, and the ice beneath his feet raises him towards Odin. The Asgardians start to react, thinking it's an attack, but Laufey just stands face- to-face with Odin. Asgardian and Jotun alike look on uneasily, unsure what's about to happen. Laufey sizes up Odin, notices that as powerful as the Allfather still is, the years have taken their toll. He's not the foe he once was. The two rulers talk quietly, out of earshot of the others.ODINLaufey. End this.LAUFEYYour boy sought this out.ODINYou're right. These are the actions of a boy. Treat them as such. You and I can stop this before there's further bloodshed. Unseen by Odin and the others, Laufey starts to form an ice blade at the end of his arm.LAUFEYWe are beyond diplomacy now, Allfather. He'll get what he came for -- war and death. Odin looks grim, determined.ODINSo be it.Without warning, Laufey swings his ice blade at Odin, but Odin is quicker. The Allfather brings his spear down upon the ice. Laufey and the nearest Jotuns go falling backwards in a wave, the ice cracking beneath their feet. The other Frost Giants turn tail and run. Thor watches the fleeing Jotuns with delight.42."b"THORNow! We'll finish them together!ODINSilence!Odin raises his spear. The hole in the sky opens, the Bifrost energy blasting forth from it. The Bifrost envelops the Asgardians, yanks them off the ground and up through the hole. The vortex closes behind them as all falls silent. Laufey stares up after them contemptuously.INT.

When he speaks again, there's something terrifying beneath the calmness of his words.ODINA fool, yes! I was a fool to think you were ready.Loki takes a step towards Odin imploringly.LOKIFATHER--Odin turns and gives Loki a look which stops him in his tracks.ODINThor Odinson... You have disobeyed the express command of your King. Through your arrogance and stupidity, you have opened these peaceful Realms and innocent lives to the horrors of war. The Allfather plunges Gungnir into Observatory's control panel. The turret turns, the Bifrost energy building along with Odin's rage. It FIRES, as the Bifrost opens at the end of the platform, creating a portal behind Thor. Odin turns angrily to his son.ODIN (CONT'D)You are unworthy of this Realm...

A FINGER OF LIGHTNING comes off the hammer and hits Thor, disintegrating the right arm of his armor and part of the chest piece.ODIN (CONT'D)...and of his father before...

He walks over to it slowly, reaches out to it, lifts it between his forearms off its pedestal. As he does, a blueness spreads from his arms, across his body. The latticework behind the Casket starts to separate, the Destroyer rousing. A fire starts to glow within its black metal armor, as it rattles to life, but Loki ignores it -- the blueness spreading further, consuming his whole body.ODIN (O.S.)Stop!Loki turns, sees Odin hurrying into the room, the Destroyer goes motionless, the latticework rejoining before it. Odin eyes Loki with dismay.LOKIAm I cursed?ODINNo. Put the Casket down. Loki sets the Casket back upon its pedestal, his body quickly returning to its normal form and color. He stares at his father.LOKIWhat am I?ODINYou\'re my son.LOKIWhat more than that? Odin doesn\'t answer. He looks suddenly weary, burdened. Loki sizes him up, realizes the truth.60.'b"LOKI (CONT'D)The Casket wasn't the only thing you took from Jotunheim that day, was it?Odin looks him in the eye.

Odin\'s body begins to shake, he lifts his hand. It starts to move out of synch temporarily, leaving a trail, the effect of the Odinsleep approaching. Loki doesn\'t notice as Odin tries to fight it off.ODINListen to me!Loki strides away towards the exit.ODIN (CONT\'D)Loki!Odin starts towards him, when the enormous mental, emotional, and physical strain of recent events finally takes its toll. The effect of the Odinsleep consumes him. His entire body now moves out of sync with the rest of the world, leaving trails behind him as he staggers backwards.

As he gives up, the next man steps up and takes his turn, straining from the effort. Other Townies SNAP PICTURES of the scene with their cell phones. They hear an approaching RUMBLE, then clear a path as a large PICK-UP TRUCK backs its way down the crater\'s edge. An EAGER TOWNIE hops out the passenger side and pulls a thick chain from the back of the truck.

She speaks softly to him.FRIGGAI asked him to be honest with you from the beginning.

He falls to the ground. 84."b"Thor notices the AR-15 rifle lying on the ground beside the fallen Guard. He stares down at the weapon quizzically. As more GUARDS approach, Thor snatches up the weapon and takes cover in the shadows of the trailer. The Guards pass by. Thor peers around the corner, sees the well-guarded main entrance tube to the center of the site. A bright light suddenly illuminates his face. He looks to see an ATV moving across the site, shining its spotlight right on him. Thor sees that the ATV DRIVER has spotted him. The Driver raises his radio to report. Thor knows he has to act fact. He raises the rifle -- then flips it over in the air and catches it by the barrel. He rears the weapon back, then hurls it like a hammer. It flies through the air, smashing the ATV's spotlight. Glass and debris shower the driver, who takes his hands off the wheel to protect himself. The ATV roars out of control past the Guards near the tube entrance. The Guards notice and chase after it. Thor emerges from the shadows, watches the Guards abandoning the site entrance.EXT. EDGE OF CRATER 80A 80A 80AThe ATV Driver looks forward in panic as the ATV approaches the crater lip.

He can actually see Mjolnir within the middle of the structure, when -- BAM! From out of nowhere, a fist lands a powerful blow across his jaw, sending him reeling.

He lunges forward, whipping his feet in front of him, then kicks out, nailing the Huge Agent in the chest. The Agent goes down hard as Thor's momentum carries him past. Thor stands, heads for the cube structure, when the Huge Guard grabs his ankle in a last effort.

The Destroyer unleashes a blast at Sif. She barely dives off of the behemoth in time, dodging the blast. The Destroyer rises again to its full height, pulling free from Sif's staff, the weapon slipping through the slats of its armor.

Debris from the battle begins to rise up into the sky. The Destroyer stays there, kept grounded by its massive weight.It lifts its head up at the Thunder God, opens its faceplate, locks it in place, unleashes its blast. Thor dives downwards straight at it, with Mjolnir before him. Mjolnir collides with the Destroyer's fiery energy blast, overpowering it, pushing it back, forcing it downwards at the Destroyer. Thor jams his hammer deep into the Destroyer's faceplate. The fiery energy within the creature builds up and EXPLODES within him, firing out of all his openings. Thor smashes the Destroyer to the ground in a tremendous heap, the fiery energy within it extinguished forever. Thor pulls Mjolnir from its faceplate, walks away from its lifeless carcass.

Loki lifts Thor into the air, impaled on the spear, and hurls him across the bridge.Thor, bleeding, rises to his knees. Loki strides up behind him to finish him off, when Thor swing his hammer around. It passes through him. Instantly, another Loki appears next to him, Thor swings his hammer, but that too is an illusion. Loki after Loki appears, Thor futilely swinging at each one, never making contact. Thor falls back to his knees. The Lokis grin as their raises their spears, encircling him.LOKISI was always more clever than you.THORYet still not clever enough.

Thor steps over to his fallen brother, lying dazed on his back. Loki winces, prepares for the worst, when Thor steps away. Loki opens his eyes, tries to stand, but can't. He looks confused, then sees what the problem is -- Mjolnir rests atop his chest. Struggle as he may, Loki can't lift it off. He's pinned to the ground. Thor looks about him desperately -- at the Bifrost firing towards Jotunheim, gaining in strength, at the surge of energy moving through the Bridge. He's at a loss of what to do.

Loki thinks fast.LOKI (CONT'D)If you destroy the Bridge, you'll never see her again! Loki grabs Gungnir, runs towards him, ready to pierce Thor through the back.THORForgive me.Summoning every bit of strength he has left, Thor raises Mjolnir one last time, drawing lightning to it from all sides, and brings it down with a final, terrible blow -- KRAKABOOM! The Bifrost SHATTERS, rainbow energy EXPLODING out of it. Both Loki and Thor are hurled into the air by the force of the blast. A wave of destruction moves forward along the Bridge towards the Observatory, breaking it apart as it goes. The Observatory RIPS ITSELF APART.

Trask looks at them, a beat.  *TRASKYou know, when I was growing up, I wasnt as strong as the other kids. They could run faster, throw a ball further. They thought they would always be superior. They had the sunny confidence, the arrogance, that comes from ignorance.

You under-estimated your enemy. If you do that with this enemy...(motions to the file)...it wont be some border skirmish halfway around the world. This time, the war will be for our cities, our streets, our homes. And by the time you see the need for my program, it will be too late, gentlemen, and you will have lost two wars in one lifetime.
