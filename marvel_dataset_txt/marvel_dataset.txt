And we use them to bring everybody back.\nBRUCE BANNER\nJust like that?\nSTEVE\nYeah.  Just like that.\nNo one speaks.  Finally...\nNATASHA\nIf there\xe2\x80\x99s even the smallest chance we can undo this, then we owe it to everyone who\xe2\x80\x99s not sitting here to try.\nEveryone looks around the room...AGREED.\nBRUCE BANNER\nIf we do this...why would it end any differently than it did before?11"b"12\nCAROL DANVERS\nBecause before you didn\xe2\x80\x99t have me.\nRHODEY\nHey, new girl.

You can only get there if you\xe2\x80\x99re incredibly small.  Hope,  she\xe2\x80\x99s my...she was supposed to pull me out.  But then Thanos happened.

No talking to our past selves.  No betting on sporting events-\nTONY\nStop, Scott.  Stop.  Are you telling me that your plan to save the universe is more than loosely based on Back to the Future?\nSCOTT LANG\n(meaning \xe2\x80\x9cyes\xe2\x80\x9d)\nNo...\nTONY\nGood.  Because that would be horseshit.  Scientifically speaking, your brother\xe2\x80\x99s picture doesn\xe2\x80\x99t disappear just \xe2\x80\x98cause you went to the dance with your mom.   \nThat\xe2\x80\x99s not how quantum physics \nworks.\nNATASHA\nWe have to take a stand.  \nTONY\nWe did stand.

The tribes lived in \nconstant war with each other until \na warrior shaman received a vision \nfrom the Panther goddess Bast who \nled him to the Heart Shaped Herb, a \nplant that granted him super human \nstrength , speed, and instincts . \nA visual representation of the five tribes emerges as hands \nfrom the sand animation, and we see them unite, and then \nbreak apart as conflict arises .

We also have information that vibranium can be used to make weapons of mass destruction. It is a substance that does not trigger any known metal detector. It could be smuggled.

She\'s lost a lot of blood. \nWhistler snaps on a pair of s~rgical gloves, \nprobes the \nwound in Karen\'s neck with an antiseptic swab -- there\'s \ncapillary damage around the perimeter of the wound, the \ntissue looks bruised, gangrenous. \nWHISTLER \nLocalized necrosis. She\'s \nborderline. Another hour and she\'d \nbe well into the change. \nBLADE \nIt was Quinn. \nWhistler looks up at Blade, suddenly interested. \nWHISTLER \nFrost\'s little errand boy? Did you \nget a lead on him? \nBlade shakes his head. \nWHISTLER \nToo bad. 17. \nWhistler cracks open a smell"ing salt capsule and waves under \nKaren\'s no~e. As \nshe starts to stir, Whistler reaches for a \nmassive syringe filled with caustic-looking fluid. Karen \nsees the syringe, resists \nWHISTLER \nHold her. \nBlade forces Karen back.

A lot. \nWhistler sinks the needle into Karen\'s neck and depresses \nthe plunger. "Hurt" doesn\'t begin to describe what Karen \nexperiences next.

He\'d like \nnothing more than to be done with this, \nbut the only thing \nhe can do is hold Karen while she \nrides out the seizures. \nKAREN\'S POV \ngrowing darker by the moment.

Two of \nthem, the \nFAUSTINAS, are identical tNins --\nlethal-looking women with \nalabaster \nskin. \ncarafes filled with blood are situated along the table. \nAt the head of the table is GAETANO \nDRAGONETTI, current \nvampire "Overlord". Parchment skin stretched over \nskull-like features. Incalculably ancient, but still deadly \nand virile as a viper. \nDra9onetti speaks. He uses the "secret tongue" -- the \nancient vampire language. \nDRAGON ETTI \n(subtitled) \nBlade, the "Day Walker".

Amongst the \nvampire community he\'s known as an agitator. He\'s also the \nvampire equivalent of a racial supremacist. \nAt the moment, though, Frost looks more like a smug \nschoolboy who\'s been sent to see the principal. He takes a \nlook around the room, then bows his head in mock penitence. \nFROST \n(in English) \nForgive me Father, fer apparently I \nhave sinned. \xc2\xb7 \nDRAGON ETTI \n(subtitled, taking \numbrage) \nYou refuse \nto speak our language, \nyou insult the House of Erebus by \nusing the humans\' gutter-ton9ue. \nHave you no respect for tradition? \nFrost lifts his head and matches Dragonetti\'s gaze. \nFROST Why should I respect something \nwhich has \noutlived its purpose? \nThis causes quite a stir amongst the other vampires. Frost \nmight as well have slapeed Dra9onetti \nin the face. The \nconversation continues 1n English from this point on. \nPALLINTINE \nThis "establishment" of yours is an \nembarrassment.

Our \nlivelihood depends on our ability \nto blend in, on our discretion. \nFrost steps forward, emboldened. \nFROST \nYou \nsound like a lawyer. \nDragonetti looks apoplectic. LORD PALLINTINE interjects. \nPALLINTINE \nYou\'re out of line, Frost. \nFROST \nAm I? Or am I just the first to \nsay out loud what we\'ve all been \nthinking? We\'ve lived in the \ns.hadows for too long --\nDRAGON ETTI \n(cutting him off) \nThe shadows suit us, \nFrost. We\'ve \nexisted this way for thousands of \nyears. Who are you to challenge \nour ways? You\'re not even a \npure-blood --\nFROST \nLike it matters? \nDRAGONETTI \nI WAS~ A VAMPIRE --\nDragonetti slams his fist down, cutting Frost off. The \ncarafe nearby cracks, a single trickle of blood oozing out. \nHe rises, indicating the others --\nDRAGONETTI \n-- as was every other member of \nthis House. But you, Frost, you \nwere merely \n"turned". \nDragonetti spits out the last word like it was toxic .

An \nuneasy \nsilence permeates the room. Frost looks at his \nfingers, licks the blood from them, laughs. \nFROST \ncareful, old fan9. You might wake \nup \none day and find yourself \nextinct. \nFrost \nsmiles at Dragonetti a_nd calmly \nexits the room. \nCAMERA FOLLOWS him, then holds on the fractured carafe \nyet another trickle of blood ooz~ng from \nit. \nCUT TO: \n30 INT. WHISTLER'S WORKSHOP, BLADE'S CELL - DAY \nON \nKAREN as she comes to. Her wounds have been bandaged. \nShe rises, a little shaky, takes in her surroundings --She's \nin a spartan room, like a monk's cell. A collection of \nknives and daggers are scattered about. In the center of \nthese rests Blade's sword, dominating all else. \non a nearby table Karen spies a few personal effects. \nAmidst these is a TATTERED DRIVER'S LICENSE. Karen picks it \nup, inspecting it --\nLICENSE (VANESSA'S), \nthe same one we glimpsed in the prologue.

You're \nbuilding \nup a resistance to the \nserum --\nBLADE \n(impatient) \nJust do it, old man. \nWhistler nods, fitting Blade with a bite guard. Then he \npresses the pistol-injector against Blade's carotid artery. \nBlade shakes violentlr, grinding his teeth through the bite \nguard, veins cording in his \nneck. He clutches Whistler's \nhand, holding it tightly as he fights his way through the \nhellish seizure. To his credit, Whistler never lets go. \nMentor and \nstudent stare at one another as the mysterious \nserum runs its violent course. We understand that these \nshared moments, oddly private in \ntheir horror, are the glue \nwhich binds the two vampire hunters together. \nFinally, Blade slum~s forward \nin his restraints, exhausted. \nIn that moment, as if sensing \nher presence, he looks up and \nSEES --\nKAREN \nShe \ndraws back, fearful.

As she makes for it, she knocks aside a \ntarpaulin which was concealing --\nA LARGE TANK \nfilled with swirling blood plasma, choked with electrical \nleads and biomedical sensors, emitting a low-pitched \nBUZZING, like an industrial transformer. \nSOMETHING \nfloats within the tank, suspended in the murky fluid -- the \ncorpse of an emaciated OLD MAN.

As for \nour little \nhomunculus here -\n{re: tank) \n-- he's a vampire. \nWhistler raps his cane against the tank. The creature snaps \nat it reflexively. \nKAREN \nYou're joking. \nWHISTLER \nNot at all. You're looking at a \nprime specimen of the homines \nnocturna.

Whistler shrugs, rolls \nhis eyes -- one of those "can\'t please everyone" gestures. \nBLADE \nWhere does she think she\'s going? \nWhistler pulls a hospital I.D. from his pocket, handing it \nto Blade. \nWHISTLER \nI did some checking, she\'s a \nhematologist.

He pauses to inspect one of his \nmodified MACHs, sighting down the length of it. \nKAREN \nSo am I a prisoner here? \nWHISTLER \nNot at all. We just had to take \ncertain precautions before we let \nyou \ngo. \nWhistler fires up a cigarette, then starts nonchalantly \nfueling up Blade\'s Olds. \nWHISTLER \nwe hunt them, you see, moving from \none city to the next, tracking \ntheir migrations.

WHISTLER'S WORKSHOP - NIGHT \nWhistler and Karen sit at a work table. \nKaren is looking at \na blood smear slide through a microscope. \nWhistler nods. KAREN \nAll right, let's start with the \nbasics -- why do vampires need \nto \ndrink blood? \nWHISTLER \nTheir own blood \ncan't sustain \nhemoglobin. \nKAREN \nThen vampirism is a genetic defect, \njust like Hemolytic anemia? \nKAREN \nSo what about gene therapy? \nWhistler looks intrigued.

You actually \nthink \nthis could work? \nKaren pauses we can see in her expression that there's \nsomething she's been holding back. \nKAREN \nOn me, yes. On Blade, I'm not so \nsure --\n(gravely) \nThe \nproblem is, Blade \ndidn't \ncontract the vampire virus from a \nbite like I did. He was born with \nit. The irony is, I could probably \ncure every vampire but him. \nWHISTLER \nThen we're back to square one, \naren't we?

He \nedges forward, Karen \nfalling in behind him. \nTHE TANK \ncontaining the vampire has been smashed open. It's empty \nnow, with ~ust the \nsteadily draining blood seeping across \nthe floor 1n a widening pool -- and a trail of BLOODY \nFOOTPRINTS leading away. \nKaren scans the shadows.

Karen \nSCREAMS. Whistler is knocked to the floor, the flashlight \nspinning from his hand --\nThe blood-soaked vam~ire lands atop \nWhistler, HISSING like a \ncobra. And just as it's about \nto strike -- ZZZZING! \nWhistler withdraws a silver rapier which had been hidden \ninside his cane. He lunges forward --\n-- but the vampire ducks beneath the sword thrust, throwing \nitself at back Whistler. As the two of \nthem struggle, \nWhistler SCREAMS --\nKaren runs to a shelving unit where Whistler's weapons are \nstored, grabs one of the modified pistols. \nShe tries to draw a bead on the creature -- FIRES, misses, \nFIRES again -- she's getting more unnerved as the seconds \ntick by and she can't get off a clean shot anymore because \nshe might hit Whistler too and Karen hesitates now as --\nWHISTLER \nSHOOT IT!!! \n--suddenly it's right in front of her, rushing fop,ard, \nfangs \nbared! \nThe vampire knocks Karen back against the wall.

As it continues to writhe --\nTHUNK! \nWhistler swings his cane-rapier down on the \ncreature, brutally decapitating it. Finishing the job. \nThen he looks to Karen, winded. \nWHISTLER \nUnderstand this -- they are \nmonsters. Hesitate for even a \nmoment, and you\'ve lost. \nFROST ( 0.

He struggles to his feet. \nPalmiotti comes to finish him off. But in his haste he isn\'t \nwatching for Jack\'s left hook. And it\'s a beauty. Palmiotti \nis rocked as the crowd ROARS.

Because she's from the Kitchen and \nnot the Upper East Side? \nFOGGY \nBecause she had a drug problem.

The symbol of his handicap \ntransfo:r:med into a weapon of his abilities. \nON DAREDEVIL \nLEAPING from rooftop to rooftop; his senses guiding him along \nthe way. He suddenly SWAN DIVES off of a ledge and PLUMMETS \nTEN STORIES to the street below. He smiles as he falls. The \naccident took his sight. But it took his fear as well. \nHe shoots a SO-FOOT NYLON CORD from his billy club, catches \nthe railing of a fire escape, and SWINGS UP onto the roof of \nJOSIE'S BAR.

Daredevil attacks in a \nhybrid fighting style of martial arts mixed with street \nfighting. The brutal KICKS, PUNCHES, and ELBOWS come hard, \nfast and violent. Blood SPURTS. Bones CRACK. Teeth FLY. \nThis is not Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man. \nNEW ANGLE \nas the lights over the billiard tables SWING BACK AND FORTH \nin the melee.

He looks more like Buddah \nthan Budd.ah does. But what some may mistake for obesity is \nactually grotesquely over-developed muscle. \nAt Fisk's side (always at his side) sits his diminutive \nassistant, WESLEY, while TWO BODYGUARDS stand watch at the \ndoor.

My father used to tell me \nstories about the Kingpin when I was a \nchild. How one man ruled all of the \ncrime in New York City.

A hazy sun glints off the hood \nof the Cobra which, like its descendant the Milano, is orange \nand teal. \nWe MOVE DOWN AND IN on a fresh-faced girl of 18 in the \npassenger seat: MEREDITH QUILL. As \xe2\x80\x9cBrandy\xe2\x80\x9d blasts from the \ncar stereo, she pushes her fine, feathered hair from her \nmouth, and sings along, out-of-tune -  \nMEREDITH\nDo do do  do do do do do do do do!\nThe driver, a MYSTERIOUS MAN in his 30\xe2\x80\x99s, dressed in sleek, \nmod attire, LAUGHS.  \nMeredith LAUGHS too.  She SINGS and dances with abandon in \nher seat.  She\xe2\x80\x99s a lively goofball, and it\xe2\x80\x99s apparent where \nPeter Quill received much of his personality.\nEXT. DAIRY QUEEN/WOODS - MOMENTS LATER\nThe Cobra pulls beside this Dairy Queen in a desolate area.  \nEXT.

Meredith GIGGLES.\nMYSTERIOUS MAN\nThis way, my river lily.\nMEREDITH\nWhere are you taking me?\nThe Mysterious Man shows her a STRANGE SPROUT nestled amongst \nthe trees.  \nA few inches tall and decidedly alien in nature, its delicate \nlimbs twist and turn in a complex pattern.\xc2\xa9 Marvel 'b'MEREDITH (CONT\xe2\x80\x99D)\nOh.

POWER STATION - DAY\nA DIMENSIONAL CRACK SNAPS in the sky overhead.  PETER QUILL \nlooks from it to an old MATTEL ELECTRONICS FOOTBALL GAME \nconverted into a tracker.  A RED DOT APPROACHES.  \nQUILL\nShowtime, a-holes! It\xe2\x80\x99ll be here \nany minute!  \nGAMORA (O.S.)\nWhich will be its loss.  \nQuill turns toward GAMORA, loading a rifle.  DRAX, ROCKET, \nand BABY GROOT also ready themselves for battle in this \ngrand, open-air power station. Dozens of BATTERIES are \ncouched in conductor towers encircling them. Quill, Gamora, \nand Rocket wear flying rigs.  \nQUILL\nIs that a rifle?\nGAMORA\nYou don\xe2\x80\x99t know what a rifle is?\nQUILL\nI thought your thing was a sword.\nGAMORA\nWe\xe2\x80\x99ve been hired to stop an \ninterdimensional beast from feeding \non those batteries\xe2\x80\x99 energy, and I\xe2\x80\x99m \ngoing to stop it with a sword ?\nQUILL\n(mumbling to himself)\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t look at me like I\xe2\x80\x99m stupid. \nYou\xe2\x80\x99re the one being all \ninconsistent.\nA LOUDER, LARGER CRACK: something seems to be fighting its \nway through the sky. 3\n\xc2\xa9 Marvel 'b'GAMORA\nDrax, why aren\xe2\x80\x99t you wearing one of \nRocket\xe2\x80\x99s aero-rigs?\nDRAX\nIt hurts.\nGAMORA\nHurts?\nDRAX\n(muttering)\nI have sensitive nipples. \nRocket, who is working on a pair of speakers wired to Quill\xe2\x80\x99s \nWalkman, LAUGHS HARD at this. Drax points at him.\nDRAX (CONT\xe2\x80\x99D)\nWhat about him ?! What\xe2\x80\x99s he doing?!\nROCKET\nIf I finish this, we can listen to \ntunes while we work.\nDRAX\nHow is that a priority?\nROCKET\nBlame Quill! He\xe2\x80\x99s the one who loves \nmusic so much!\nQUILL\nI agree with Drax. It\xe2\x80\x99s hardly \nimportant right now.\nROCKET\nOh, sure, okayyyy, Quill.\nRocket WINKS at him.\nQUILL\nNo, I really agree with him.\nROCKET\nSure, I know .  \nRocket WINKS some more.\nDRAX\nI can clearly see you winking.\nROCKET\nDamn. I\xe2\x80\x99m using my left eye? 4\n\xc2\xa9 Marvel 'b'Rocket hears a small GROWL.  \nHe looks down and sees Baby Groot - newly unpotted, only nine \ninches tall or so - angrily THROWING ASIDE some foraging \nOrloni.  Then he looks up at Rocket, explaining:\nGROOT\nI am Groot.\nROCKET\nThey were not  looking at you funny.\nAN EVEN LARGER CRACK! \nRocket swirls as a GIGANTIC BEAST - a hundred-foot-long \nLovecraftian monstrosity - BREAKS THROUGH THE \nINTERDIMENSIONAL RIFT.  THE ABILISK is the color of a pinkie \nmouse with kaleidoscopic and deadly SPLATTER MATTER pulsing \nfrom its maw. \nROCKET (CONT\xe2\x80\x99D)\nWell. That\xe2\x80\x99s intense.\nRocket, Quill, and Gamora JET-PACK OUT OF THE WAY, while they \nBLAST at the creature.  Drax HOLLERS , CHARGING it with his \ntwin blades. Quill TURNS ON his mask.\nBut we FOCUS on baby Groot, who trots up to the stereo \nspeakers and Walkman .\nHe fiddles with two wires.  They SPARK, the stereo POWERS UP, \nand \xe2\x80\x9cMR. BLUE SKY\xe2\x80\x9d by ELECTRIC LIGHT ORCHESTRA PLAYS as -\nTHE CREDITS START\nBaby Groot DANCES IN-FOCUS in the foreground as the Guardians \nget PUMMELED by the beast OUT-OF-FOCUS in the background.  \nBaby Groot\xe2\x80\x99s dancing is arrhythmic and many of his \xe2\x80\x9cdance \nmoves\xe2\x80\x9d are nonsensical mixtures of trembling, swaying, and \nmaking weird faces. \nBut it is joyous.\nAs Groot struts, Quill comes ROLLING behind him. As he \nstands, he sees Groot dancing and looks at him, worried.\nQUILL\nGroot, look - !\nA TENTACLE FLIES IN FROM OFF-SCREEN, KNOCKING Quill OUT-OF-\nFRAME as Groot dances on, blissfully unaware. 5\n\xc2\xa9 Marvel 'b'Groot, smiling, dances onward, as DRAX, in the clutches of a \ngiant tentacle, is SLAMMED NUMEROUS TIMES BESIDE HIM.  \nGroot arrives at GAMORA, who is blasting at the OFF-SCREEN \nBEAST.  \nGAMORA\nGet out of the way, Groot! You\xe2\x80\x99re \ngoing to get hurt!\nGroot stops dancing.  He WAVES at her.\nGAMORA (CONT\xe2\x80\x99D)\nHi.\nShe AERO-JETS back into the fray.  \nAs Groot DANCES, Drax FALLS directly behind him. \nGroot FREEZES .\nDrax stares at him a moment, suspicious. Groot stays frozen.  \nDrax LEAVES, and Groot COMMENCES THE DANCE where he left off.\nGroot sees an INSECT FLYING BY. \nSuddenly dancing is forgotten and GETTING THIS BUG is all-\nimportant. He CHASES it. \nHe HOPS up and grabs it from the air...\nAnd starts EATING it.  \nRocket spots this and FLIES DOWN beside him, worried.  He \nPRIES OPEN GROOT\xe2\x80\x99S MOUTH with his fingers, frantically trying \nto get it out.\nROCKET\nSpit it out! Spit it out!\nGroot COUGHS IT OUT. The bug FLIES crookedly away, one wing \nmulched.  \nRocket JETS OFF back toward the battle, muttering:\nROCKET (CONT\xe2\x80\x99D)\nDisgusting.\nGroot sees something else and becomes furious. We follow his \nline of sight to a GRAZING ORLONI.   6\n\xc2\xa9 Marvel 'b'Groot SCREAMS A WAR CRY and ATTACKS IT.  He GROWS HIS \nBRANCHES AROUND IT, and the terrified Orloni  DARTS AWAY, \nDRAGGING GROOT WITH IT.  \nGroot\xe2\x80\x99s anger becomes panic as he is DRAGGED  AROUND BY THE \nORLONI and can\xe2\x80\x99t let go.  \nThe Orloni DARTS around the power station and underneath the \nRAGING BATTLE, a CRYING Groot bouncing along behind it.  \nFinally, he LETS GO and goes TUMBLING, ROLLING directly INTO \nTHE CAMERA.\nAnd then stands up and, as if none of it happened at all, \nstarts DANCING AGAIN .\nWe PAN and see the speakers and Walkman beside him, and we \nrealize Baby Groot has traveled around the entire Power \nStation and has arrived back where he started -\nWhen Drax is FLUNG by the beast into the stereo system, \nSMASHING it.\nGroot stops dancing. Angry that Drax has ruined his fun, he \npicks up a piece of the stereo and beats him with it.\nCREDITS END .\nDrax stands and glares at the ferocious beast as Rocket, \nQuill, and Gamora BLAST at it without effect. \nDRAX\nThe beast\xe2\x80\x99s hide is too thick to be \npierced from the outside. I must \ncut through it from the inside .\nGAMORA\nHuh?\nDrax HOLLERS, CHARGING the creature.\nGAMORA (CONT\xe2\x80\x99D)\nDrax, no! That doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make -\nThe creature OPENS ITS ENORMOUS MOUTH, SCREECHING, and Drax \nLEAPS INSIDE IT, instantly swallowed up.\nQUILL\nWhat is he doing ?!\nGAMORA\nHe said the skin is too thick to be \npierced from the outside, so he -- 7\n\xc2\xa9 Marvel 'b'QUILL\nThat doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make sense!\nGAMORA\nI tried to tell -- !\nQUILL\nIts skin is the same thickness from \nthe inside as from the out!\nGAMORA\nI REALIZE THAT .\nINT. BEAST\xe2\x80\x99S STOMACH - DOESN\xe2\x80\x99T MATTER\nDrax HOLLERS as he SLASHES AWAY inside the goo of the beast\xe2\x80\x99s \nstomach.  To no avail.\nI/E. POWER STATION - DAY\nQuill reloads his pistol, thinking.\nQUILL\nGamora, there\xe2\x80\x99s a cut on its neck - \nRocket, get it to look up.\nQuill and Rocket JET UP HIGH up over the creature as they \nBLAST REPEATEDLY at it.\nQUILL (CONT\xe2\x80\x99D)\nHey, you giant Sea Monkey, up here!\nGamora\xe2\x80\x99s rifle is jammed.  She tosses it down.  PULLS HER \nSWORD.  SNAPS IT OPEN .\nThe beast SCREECHES at Quill and Rocket FLYING overhead.  The \ncolorful SPLATTER MATTER FLIES FROM ITS MOUTH, BATTERING \nROCKET, BURNING his clothes.  \nBut its neck is exposed, where the skin is thinner, and there \nis a small wound.\nGamora DASHES, LEAPING HIGH into the air, and she PLUNGES her \nsword directly into the wound. \nShe holds tight to the hilt as she FALLS, SLICING AN INCISION \ndown the length of the creature\xe2\x80\x99s neck.\nThe beast WOBBLES, TOPPLES, and DIES.  As it COLLAPSES, Drax \nSPILLS OUT of the wound. He raises his arms in victory.\nDRAX\nHa ha! I have single-handedly \nvanquished the beast! 8\n\xc2\xa9 Marvel 'b'Quill SCOFFS. Rocket SNORTS. Gamora stares at him, dead-eyed.  \nBaby Groot throws a rock at him.\nDRAX (CONT\xe2\x80\x99D)\nWhat?\nI/E. POWER STATION - MOMENTS LATER\nThe Guardians de-rig by the Anulax batteries.  \nDRAX\nWhat are they called again?\nQUILL\nAnulax batteries.  \nDRAX\nHarbulary batteries .\nQUILL\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s nothing like what I just \nsaid. But they\xe2\x80\x99re worth thousands \nof units a piece. Which is why the \nSovereign hired us to protect them.  \nRocket pulls out one of the ANULAX BATTERIES, checking it \nout.\nGamora, Drax, and Quill walk on.  Rocket stays back a moment. \nQuill nods down the walkway, where GOLDEN SOVEREIGN CITIZENS \nstand at the edge of the station, gawking.  \nQUILL (CONT\xe2\x80\x99D)\nJust be careful what you say around \nthese folks. They\xe2\x80\x99re easily \noffended and the cost of \ntransgression is death.\nDRAX\nSounds judgmental for a bunch of \ngolden morons.\nQUILL\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s the kind of thing you might \nwant to keep to yourself.\nGAMORA\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll hold my tongue, as long as \nthey deliver what was promised.\nEXT.

Bring it \nand we shall gladly be on our way.\nAyesha nods.  \nTwo SOLDIERS emerge with A WOMAN in a hood and cloak, her \nwrists bound by SHACKLES.  They SHOVE HER TO HER KNEES and \nyank back her hood, REVEALING -- 10\n\xc2\xa9 Marvel 'b'NEBULA. Her clothes are tattered.  Her hand is now just a low-\ntech metal claw.  \nShe glares at Gamora.  Gamora glares at her. Quill looks from \none to the other, feeling the tension.\nQUILL\n(quietly)\nFamily reunion. Yaaaay.\nAYESHA\nI understand she is your sister?\nGamora roughly picks Nebula up, starts to go.  \nGAMORA\nShe\xe2\x80\x99s worth no more to me than the \nbounty due for her on Xandar.\nAYESHA\nOur soldiers apprehended her \nattempting to steal the batteries. \nDo with her as you please. \nQUILL\nThank you, High Priestess Ayesha.\nQuill starts to go.\nAYESHA\nWhat is your  heritage, Mr. Quill?\nQuill turns back towards her, uncomfortable with the \nquestion.\nQUILL\nMy mother is from earth.\nAYESHA\nAnd your father?\nQUILL\nHe\xe2\x80\x99s... not from Missouri, that\xe2\x80\x99s \nall I know.\nAyesha stares at him as if she\xe2\x80\x99s eaten something foul.\nAYESHA\nI see it within you, an unorthodox \ngenealogy. A hybrid that seems \nparticularly... reckless. \nQuill tries not to let this affect him, but it does. Rocket \ngrins a huge, fake grin at Ayesha. 11\n\xc2\xa9 Marvel 'b'ROCKET\nYou know, they told me you people \nwere conceited douchebags. But that \nisn\xe2\x80\x99t true at all.\nRocket turns to Quill and WINKS.

Who \ndoes she think she is?\nGAMORA\nI know you\xe2\x80\x99re sensitive about that.\nQUILL\nI\xe2\x80\x99m not sensitive about it.

And Ego gazes at Quill with adoration.  \nEGO (CONT\xe2\x80\x99D)\nI searched for you for so long. \nWhen I heard a man from earth held \nan Infinity Stone in his hand \nwithout dying, I knew you must be \nthe son of the woman I loved.\nEgo puts his hand on Quill.

U.S. BORDER, EL PASO, TEXAS. \nBeneath the sign is a LONG BLACK LIMOUSINE. \nCars whip past on the highway. Then A VAN passes, blasting \nsome future version of Techno Latino Hip Hop. A SQUEAL OF \nTIRES OS. Now the music gets louder as the van returns, \ncruising slowly past the black limo before pulling into the \nlot. Five Bangers bail out and check out the black stretch. \nThe limo doors are locked, windows tinted, so they can\xe2\x80\x99t see \nwhat\xe2\x80\x99s inside, but they check out the tires and wheels and \nlike what they see.

Yes, he\xe2\x80\x99s a drunk, but he\xe2\x80\x99s also fading on the inside. \nAdamantium implants leeching into his system, causing chronic \npain and diminished healing, hence booze as painkiller. \nSo by all means, go ahead and worry about him. \nNow where were we? Oh, yeah--\nAs the smoke settles, a CROWBAR-toting Banger angrily chews \nout Jitters in Spanish for firing.

Final Shooting - 8/23/2016 2.'b'He tries his best to keep them from the limo, catches one \nguy\xe2\x80\x99s bat an inch before it would dent the car.  \nAnother one of them shoots in that direction, but Logan puts \nhimself in front of the bullet. The pain from that little \nmove stops him long enough for them to resume the pummeling. \nSuddenly, Logan\xe2\x80\x99s eyes go yellow, pupils dilating. He lets \nout a long, loud yell. Fury rockets up in him, like cocaine.\nHE STANDS AND RAMS HIS CLAWS INTO CROWBAR and kicks another \nBanger into the back of the open van. Yet another runs at \nLogan only to get gored in the neck and tossed. This is real \nwork for Logan, not easy. And it is fueled by rage. \nJitters again raises his sawed-off, he will nail the car for \nsure, but Logan slices off his arm above the elbow. \nSadly for Logan, the hand, while disconnected from the body \nit once belonged to, is still holding the gun. So, as it hits \nthe dirt, the gun goes off, putting several pellet-sized \nholes in the door of the limo. \nThis, more than anything else, doubles Logan anger--\nLOGAN (CONT\xe2\x80\x99D)\nMotherf--\nWHO GETS HIT ONCE MORE --and then goes after the last banger \nwho, seeing he had his chance, leaps into the van and spins \nout of the lot, his wounded compadre in back, spilling onto \nthe dirt as the van bounces back onto the road. \nLogan picks up his keys, some loose change and a single \nsilver bullet. He stands, staring at the holes in his \notherwise pristine stretch as RAIN BEGINS TO FALL. \nHe sucks in deep breaths, forcing himself to regain control. \nHis eyes return to normalcy.

Run!\nThe children comply, Laura most hesitant as -- \nLogan stumbles to position himself between the children and \nthe unstoppable fully healed creature charging at him --\nX-24 GORES LOGAN WITH BOTH HIS CLAWS and, using them like \ngrappling hooks, drags Logan off to the forest's edge. \nLAURA\nNo!Final Shooting - 8/23/2016 123."b"X24 heaves Logan onto a fallen stump, A JAGGED WOOD LIMB \nSPEARING THROUGH LOGAN'S TORSO.

He collapses to the \nground. Done. \nLaura stands ten feet away, holding the smoking pistol. Her \neyes meet Logan's and she drops the gun and runs to him. \nLOGAN AND LAURA\nShe hacks Logan from the tree stump. Logan slides painfully \nto the forest floor. He struggles to breathe. His body is \ndecimated, his skeleton showing through his wounds.\nLaura's eyes are wild and fearful. She can see he is mortally \nwounded... She kneels.\nLAURA\nno, no, no...\nLOGAN\n...Take your friends and run. Go. \nListen to me, Laura. Run.

Final Shooting - 8/23/2016 124."b"And then his breath releases and he is very still. \nLaura squeezes his limp hand. Disbelieving that he has \npassed. But there is nothing left in him. \nStill holding his hand, Laura looks up at her friends, tears \nin her eyes. The other children gather closer. \nWIDER ON -- ALL THE CHILDREN IN A CIRCLE AROUND LOGAN. They \njust stand there in the blast-radius of the carnage as the \nsun drifts lower in the sky. \nLAURA (O.S.)\nA man has to be what he is, Joey. \nYou can't break the mould. \nEXT.

Laura stares \nunrelenting at Logan as the dirt covers him. \nLAURA\nThere's no living with a killing. \nThere's no going back. Right or \nwrong, it's a brand. A brand that \nsticks. Now run on home to your \nmother, and tell her everything's \nalright. There's no more guns in \nthe valley...\nThe children all look to Rictor. \nRICTOR\nWe gotta go.\nThe children all grab their backpacks and start on the \nmountain trail to Canada. \nBut Laura hesitates, still looking at Logan's grave. She does \nnot move, but then, tearful, grabs her own backpack.

The bike stalls. He kicks wildly at the starter: dead. And it's 5:48.\nPeter leaps off the bike.

It reads ID CONFIRMED: PARKER, PETER.\nHARRY\nI guess you're who you seem to be.\nPETER\nPlease just tell me you didn't put a camera in the bathroom.\nHarry taps, and all the barriers retract; the beams die.

COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY \xe2\x80\x94 DAVIS AUDITORIUM \xe2\x80\x94 NIGHT\nPacked house of researchers, reporters, interested members of \nthe public. PROF. CZERNOWITZ is introducing Otto Octavius.\nCZERNOWITZ\n...as a doctoral candidate he was dazzling. Now I'm afraid he's left \nus mere mortals far behind. It's my \ngreat honor to present, director of the Anansi Project, winner of a \nNational Science Medal, Dr. Otto \nOctavius.\nAPPLAUSE as Otto strides out. Younger than you might expect. Wearing a long black Gaultier jacket. Smiling like a manwith a surprise in store for us. He and Czernowitz meet. A \nstiffness between them. Czernowitz looks intimidated.\nOTTO\nFrank.\nCZERNOWITZ\nOtto.\nThey shake hands awkwardly. Then Otto strides to the podium. Grins, self mocking. Behind him on a table, a violin and\nbow. Piano to one side."b'11.\n(CONT\'D)\n(CONT\'D)\n(CONT\'D)OTTO\nHe told you I was "dazzling," but \nwhat he\'s too nice to bring up is \nwas what an insufferable little wretch I was.\nLaughter. The lights dim; spot on Otto. Behind him a large flatpanel monitor descends. As he talks, the display will \nmirror, expand on and illustrate his words.\nOTTO\nBiomimetics seeks to adapt for \nhuman use the technologies of other species. We poor humans have always \nenvied our fellow creatures their \ntalents; soon we will share them. \nPeter is rapt; Harry is playing Tetris on his Palm Pilot.\nOTTO\nMy own researches have been into arachnid technology: adapting, the remarkable abilities of spiders, \ntheir web-spinning abilities, their \nastonishing, almost precognitive impulse control.\nHarry notices how spellbound Peter is; leans over.\nHARRY\nI will never understand this spider thing of yours.\nPeter takes no notice.\nOTTO\nWe had some success with manipulating spider RNA. But it\'s \nin the area of octopedal locomotion \nthat things are really getting exciting. The goal is to provide \nstable motion on every possible \nkind of terrain and superior manipulation at a distance.\nOtto steps out from behind the podium.\nOTTO\nYou can\'t imagine the sheer number crunching might required to control \nand coordinate eight legs. Really \ntough. Actually, it was a chance visit to the Bronx Zoo that gave me \nthe key insight.'b"12.\n(CONT'D)\n(CONT'D)\n(CONT'D)\n(CONT'D)(CONT'D)He walks toward the monitor, which displays an octopus, along \nwith a diagram of its nervous system.\nOTTO\nThe octopus has the equivalent of a \npowerful processor in each leg, \nnetworked to the central unit in her brain.\nThe display fades to a diagram of the Rig, eight legs networked to each other through and to the center. The\ncenter is empty; then a diagrammatic human operator appears.\nOTTO\nNow, so far the capacity to control \nthe full complement of eight legs is beyond our capacity. But we've \nbeen able to implement a similar \nsystem using...\nOtto takes a step forward, smiling a little coyly. Then from somewhere behind him a pair of glinting pseudopods snake out. The black stealth-bomber glint of superhard ceramic. A gasp \nfrom the audience.\nOTTO\nFour!\nHarry sits up. Puts away the Palm Pilot. \nThe 'pods hover over Otto's shoulders a moment, undulant.\nOTTO\nI call it a self-articulating \nnetwork, but I'm afraid the name \nthat has stuck is Otto's Octopus.\nOne 'pod reaches to tap him on the shoulder.\nOTTO\nYes? Oh, thank you. It is a little warm in here.\nThe arms help him out of the jacket, and as it comes off, another pair of pseudopods is revealed. The audience goes a \nlittle nuts.\nOne 'pod takes up the violin; another, the bow. The next pair \nsnake out toward the piano; Otto strikes up a Grieg sonata. With his own two hands, he takes out a fat cigar and lights \nit; puffs contentedly.\nThe audience, amazed, afraid, half suspecting that it's all a \nprank. "b'13.\n(CONT\'D)\n(CONT\'D)\n(CONT\'D)\n(CONT\'D)\n(CONT\'D)Peter with a look of open-mouthed wonder. The music breaks \noff.\nNow the \'pods assume a configuration like a daddy long-legs, \n"toes" splayed against the dais, arching high into the air. \nAmong them hangs, perfectly at ease, Otto. One at a time, in\nturn, he raises and lowers each foot.\nOTTO\nEach one of my four assistants here is equipped with its own hundred-\nteraflop processor.\nHe begins to stride back and forth across the stage on his four dancing pseudopods.\nOTTO\nComputer architecture so \nsophisticated and capable of learning it approaches \nconsciousness.\nHe sinks back onto the two lower \'pods. The upper ones snake out around him.\nOTTO\nAt times I feel the Rig here has a \nlife of its own.\nLEFT UPPER PSEUDOPOD takes a piece of paper from Otto\'s pocket. RIGHT UPPER produces a pen and scrawls something across the paper. Then the \'pod with the paper slaps it\nacross Otto\'s back. He turns around, as if confused, walking \non the lower pseudopods. The sign says GEEK!\nLaughter from the audience. They\'re eating this up. Otto, \nback to the audience, whirls his head around.\nOTTO\nGiven time, and a strong enough host...\n(rueful smile)\n...its systems and my own would actually begin to integrate with \neach other--\nThe pseudopods rip away his shirt, revealing THE RIG nestled right up against his spine, overlapping his own flesh.\nOTTO \n--Merge into one organism.'b"14.\nAUDIENCE\nShock, even revulsion at the sight of the implants. Then a \nsurge of APPLAUSE.\nPETER\nGapes, bowled over.\nPETER\nYou have to introduce me to him!\nHARRY\nDon't you have a diva waiting?\nPeter checks his watch.\nPETER\nI can make it.\nINT. DAVIS AUDITORIUM - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT\nOtto lurches in on the pseudopods to a ROAR of applause from \nthe hall.\nThe 'pods telescope in and Otto falls to the floor. But one \nof the 'pods remains slightly extended.\nOTTO'S team crowds around him and drag him over to the NEURAL \nCOUPLER UNIT. They mount it around him.\nThe TEAM LEADER twists the Rig's LATCH. This is a dial with a \nglass tube at its heart, like a spirit level, with a single\nglowing bubble of air. He aligns the bubble with a mark and--WHAM-the 'pod LASHES out and knocks the Team Leader aside.\nINT. DAVIS AUDITORIUM - AUDIENCE - NIGHT\nPeople are still applauding. But Peter's spider-sense \nTINGLES. He gets up.\nPETER\nI'll meet you in the lobby.\nHARRY \nWhere are you--\nPETER \nToo much coffee.\nINT. DAVIS AUDITORIUM - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT\nThe Rig is out of control. Otto hangs from it like a doll.\nThe pseudopods whip and buzzsaw. Smash lightbulbs. Scatter \nhumans."b"15.\n(CONT'D)Spider-Man leaps into the middle of the cyclone. He tries to \nreach Otto. The 'pods feint and block.\nHe fires web snares at the pods; pins them to the wall. They \nbreak free, lash out. Knock Spider-Man down.\nSpidey leaps up, fires a strand in either direction, snags\nthe upper two 'pods. Yanks them toward himself. Ties them in \na knot. They GRIND in protest. Keeping a grip on the knot \nhe--\nSpins a thick cocoon around each of the lower ones, padding \neach out until it's a gently flailing balloon. The Rig struggles for a moment, then powers down. Otto falls to the \nfloor, the 'pods knotted across him.\nSpider-Man kneels beside Otto. Making sure he's okay.\nThe Team Members hurry over with the coupler. Spider-Man gets \nout of the way. The team gets Otto into i and the Team Leader \ntwists the Latch.\nSPLORCH. The rig pops open. Otto falls out.\nWe see that Otto's bare, muscular back is enhanced by four \nneural sockets. They roll him over.\nOtto opens his eyes. The irises of his eyes seem to be \nleaking into the whites: pinwheels. Strange flowers. Octopi.\nASSISTANT \nLook at his eyes!\nASSISTANT 2\nWe're overdoing the endorphin push.\nTEAM LEADER\nThat's the symbiosis routines in \nthe Rig.

They try to help him.\nOTTO\nI'm fine! Thank you. I'm fine. Now, get off me.\nHe stands up, shaky. Brushes off their helping hands."b"16.\n(CONT'D)\n(CONT'D)TEAM LEADER\nOtto, it was too long. You stayed \nin the Rig too long.\nOTTO\nNo, the problem is that I didn't \nstay in it long enough! My system never gets the chance to reach \nequilibrium with the Rig's!\nThey stare at him. Is he serious? He looks around. Sees the broken light bulb. The slashed curtain. The shattered chair. \nHe sits down.\nOTTO\nMaybe I stayed in the rig too long, I don't know.\nThey bring him a glass of water and a clean shirt. He accepts their ministrations.\nOTTO\nThank you.

DAVIS AUDITORIUM - BACKSTAGE CORRIDOR\nHarry introduces Peter to Otto; they're shaking hands. Otto \nlooks a bit frazzled but basically fine.\nHARRY\nDoesn't it hurt to be jacked into \nthat thing?\nOTTO\nActually, thanks to the endorphin \nboosters it feels very good. Coming out's a bitch.\nPETER\nIt's so great to meet you. And the \nRig's pretty--cool.\nOTTO \nStill one or two--\n(twitches his head)\nKinks to work out. But basically sound."b"17.\n(CONT'D)PETER\nActually, Doctor, I was hoping to \nhear you talk about the superspider \nresearch.\nOTTO\nAh. Well. Unfortunately we lost our funding for that project. I'm \nafraid it was rather poorly \nmanaged. And please... call me Otto. Any friend of the Osborns is \nmy friend. The Rig's materials and \nkinetechnology is all Oscorp design and build. Norman Osborn was a huge \nsupporter of my work. A steady and \ngenerous supporter. Not too mention a true original. A man, in a world \nof mediocrities.

RENARD, the actor playing \nHENRY FRANKENSTEIN, lounges beside her, calm where she's \nworried. He's very good-looking.\nRENARD\nJust remember, acting is reacting.\nMJ \nGot it.\nClearly troubled rather than nervous. The door to thedressing room opens. MJ turns expectantly. ANOTHER ACTOR'S there, costumed as an Angry Villager.\nMJ\nDid you check Will Call?\nACTOR\nThe ticket is still there.\nMJ looks sad. Puts on the wig, tugs it straight, and smiles at herself. Big theatrical smile. The show must go on.\nRenard pulls a chair over, sits down right beside MJ.\nRENARD\nHey, cheer up. There's a TV crew \nhere, you know. From New York 1. They heard about your big debut.\nMJ\nHow did they hear?\nRENARD\nI don't know. Somebody must have \ncalled them. Somebody who likes the \nway you... act.\nFlirting hard. He brushes a flake of mascara from her cheek.\nRENARD\nSo, who is he, your Mr. No-Show?\nMJ\nA friend of mine.\nACTOR \nBoyfriend?\nMJ\nNo. Just a friend.

The \ncruisers in pursuit.\nIt\'s a rag-top; THREE GUYS. Two in the back with machine \nguns. Oh, like Spider-Man didn\'t see that coming! Spider Man flies elegantly through their fire. Snags the two shooters.\nPins them to light posts and hangs them out for the police.'b"22.\nNow Spider-Man turns to the DRIVER. Lands on the car. Is \nthrown off. Shot at. Keeps coming back.\nIn the end he crawls under the car, comes over top, webs up \nthe Driver's gun. Manages to get them both out just before \nthe car slams into a big construction site dumpster and \nEXPLODES.\nEXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - NIGHT\nTWO POLICEMEN come running over. Spider-Man lowers the poor \nbastard down to them on a line, headfirst. They grab him and\ncuff him. One leads him away.

NINTH AVENUE - NIGHTSpider-Man, swings back toward the theater. Spider sense \nTINGLES. His head snaps left.\nAtop a building nearby, the flash of a sniper's rifle. The \nnext instant a shot rings out. A bullet snips the dragline neatly in two. It goes slack and Spider-Man falls out of the \nsky. Spider-Man plummets to the ground.\nA MOTHER is pushing TWINS in a stroller. Right under him. \nMoving like a diver he twists around. Fires a web that snags \na small billboard across the street. He stops falling.\nThe webbing peels the entire top sheet off the billboard, in \na single piece. Peter falls the last four feet or so. Manages to arrest his fall, slamming his shoulder into the pavement. \nNearly hits the TWINS.\nMOTHER \nManiac! Idiot!\nPeter stumbles to his feet. Two big BRUISERS rush him. One carries a pair of heavy-duty handcuffs. They're on him.\nThey're big, but Peter handles them easily with a little fake \nkung fu. Then he looks up.

He takes her by the arm. She shakes it off. She isn't going to even speak to him. On second thought-- She \nturns back to him.\nMJ\nYou know, when you said you wanted to be friends, I believed you.\nPETER\nI do want to be friends.\nMJ\nWell, then you aren't a very good \nfriend, are you?\nPETER\nI tried, MJ.

Peter will never know. Renard comes out of the theater. Checks out Peter.\nRENARD\nGood night, MJ. You were wonderful.\nGives her a big hug. When he lets go, MJ is staring right at Pete. Her look says, See? You could lose me. Renard gives \nPeter the fisheye and then walks off.\nPETER\nMJ. You aren't-- are you...\nMJ\nRenard's just a friend. Why. Do you wish I was seeing somebody? Would \nyou like to get rid of me and for \nall?\nPETER \nMJ--\nMJ\nNo. No, I think you enjoy this idea you have that I'm going around \ncarrying a torch for you.

You don't know how much I think about you. How \nmuch I--\nMJ\nNo, that's right. I don't know \nanything. I've known you since the first grade but I don't know \nanything about you."b"26.\nPeter takes a step toward her. Looks into her eyes. Six \ninches of air separates him from having her.\nHis PAGER goes off. He's embarrassed, fumbles with it.\nPETER\nSorry. It's--oh. It's Aunt May.\nShe hardly ever pages me. I better--\nMJ watches him go. Typical.\nEXT. PAYPHONE - NIGHT\nPeter's on the phone, worried.\nPETER\nAunt May? Aunt May, what's the \nmatter? Why are you crying?\nINT.

What--\nMAY \nThere's a fly.\nPETER \nA fly?\nMAY\nA fly, a bee, I don't know what it \nis. Buzzing all around the house, \nit's driving me insane!

If we could detect such things, we would sense that the \nfly feels a sudden alarm.\nINT.

You don't know- everything there is to know, \nAunt May. About how Uncle Ben died. \nThe guy who-- that punk.\n(deep breath)\nI had a chance to stop him.\nMAY What?\nPETER\nThe guy. I ran into him. A couple \nof hours before he shot Uncle Ben. \nHe was robbing this place. And I knew it. And I could have stopped \nhim easily. But I let him run right \npast me. Because at the time it didn't seem like my problem.\nShe's just looking at him. Dry-eyed.

Quiet fury.\nMAY\nI mean, on the surface, it does \nseem to be something fairly unforgivable.\nPETER \nAunt May?\nShe swings the china plate above her head, then brings it down against the counter. It shatters.\nMAY \nDamn it!\nShe crouches stiffly and begins to pick up the pieces. Peter goes to help her but she pushes him away. As she tosses \nshards into the trash, she cuts herself.\nMAY\nOw! Damn it.\nPokes her finger into her mouth. Peter tries to put his handon her shoulder.\nMAY\nGet away from me. Get out!\nHe backs away. She takes the Dustbuster from the broom closet and begins noisily to bust dust. Steely eyed.\nPETER \nAunt May--\nShe ignores him, vacuuming. He turns and walks out.\nEXT. BQE - NIGHT\nPeter roars back to the city. As he slows in some traffic, \nthe bike begins to backfire and throw sparks. Then it actually bursts into flame. Fellow motorists honk at him. One \nleans out of a passing car."b"31.\n(CONT'D)FELLOW MOTORIST\nYo, butthead, your motorcycle is on \nfire.\nPeter scrambles over onto the shoulder. Leaps off the burning bike.

Why can't I have one thing in my life \nthat actually works!\nFellow motorists slow their cars to watch as Peter's spider strength renders the bike a heap of junk in seconds.\nPETER\nCan't-- even-- cross town without \nbursting into flames-- or being shot at!\nPeter stands over the corpse of the bike, heart POUNDING.

He almost got \nkilled today.\nHARRY \nI know.\n(beat)\nWho do you think put up the bounty?\nOnscreen, Norman Osborn is laughing, now, too. A strangely \nfamiliar laugh.

I \nmeant reward.\nPETER\nHarry, what you're talking about \nis--\nHARRY\nMurder? Maybe. People get murdered, Pete. My father. Your uncle. It \nhappens.\nThe tape goes blank. Harry's eyes fill with static. Peter gets up.\nPETER\nI think--it would probably be best \nfor me to move out.\nHARRY\nWhat? Because of what I said about Spider-Man? Pete, don't be--\nPETER\nMr. Aziz fired me today, Harry. And \nI can't work for the Bugle anymore. \nSo. I can't afford to pay you rent anymore.\nHARRY\nYou'll find another job.

That's my \nmachine.\nThe man decides that Peter is mad. He begins to stuff his clothes back into the sack.\nYOUNG MAN \nOkay, mister. Take it easy.\nHe shoulders the bag and hurries out.\nYOUNG MAN \nThe yellow light's flashing.\nPeter waits a moment, then runs over to the machine.\nThe OUT OF BALANCE light is blinking.

He closes his eyes.\nHARRY\'S NIGHTMARE\nHe\'s shaking hands with his father. They\'re both smiling. \nThen with a horrible wet sound Harry splits open, right down \nthe center, and Norman Osborn steps out of the husk. The real Norman starts to laugh his GOBLIN laugh.\nBACK ON HARRY\nHe opens his eyes. Real pain in them.\nHARRY\nThey\'re disgusting. I don\'t want to \ntalk about them. Just, please. Give \nme something to help me sleep through them.\nThe doctor stares at him. Sighs. Reaches for the prescription pad.\nINT. MARTIN BECK THEATER - AUDIENCE\nOtto sits in the fifth row, center.

DRESSING ROOM - CONTINUOUS\nMJ runs into the dressing room, flings herself onto a \nbattered sofa. There\'s a Bugle lying there; she tosses it toward Renard.\nMJ\nThe Bugle was right. I do "manage \nto be both overstated and paper-\nthin at the same time."\nRENARD\nSomeone doesn\'t agree with you or the Bugle.\nHe points to a big bouquet of black roses, with a card. She goes to them, intrigued, charmed, irritated all at once. \nOpens the card.\nMJ\nIf Peter thinks he can...\nTHE CARDIt reads: I THINK YOU ARE BRILLIANT.\nO.O.\nMJ "O.O.?"\nRENARD \nOh oh.\nEXT. MARTIN BECK THEATER - NIGHT\nMJ is walking out, carrying the flowers. Otto approaches, but \nkeeps a certain distance.

I--I sent you those flowers.\nMJ \nOh oh.\nOTTO\nI hope that wasn\'t out of line. Was \nit? It was. Excuse me. I\'m sorry.'b"43.\n(CONT'D)He turns and walks away. Shaking his head. Not so much \nembarrassed as disturbed by the failure of his experiment.\nMJ \nNo! I mean--\nOTTO\nI won't bother you again.\nMJ \nWait!\nSlowly Otto turns back.\nMJ\nI loved the flowers. I've been sort of hoping somebody might send me \nflowers.\nOTTO \nPeter Parker?\nMJ\nYeah...? How do you...?\nOTTO\nPeter's a friend. Of a friend.\nHonestly, I don't really know him very well at all. But he's the one \nwho told me about you. About your \nbeing in this show. Which I loved. It was beautiful. You were \nbrilliant, I meant it.\nMJ\nThank you. Unfortunately the drama \ncritic of the Daily Bugle doesn't agree with you.\nOTTO\nThe man is a well-known idiot.\nMJ \nReally?\nOTTO\nLegendary.\nShe likes this. The bubble of weirdness between them pops. We can almost hear it. MJ salutes him with the roses.\nMJ\nThanks for these."b"44.\nMJ and the roses go very well together. Otto stares. Inner \nturmoil visible. A long beat goes by. She turns to leave.\nOTTO\nDo you believe in the value of \nboldness, Miss Watson?\nMJ\nAt all times.\nOTTO\nHave dinner with me. Right now.\nMJ hesitates. Not because she doesn't want to; because she does. This is a big yes for her.\nMJ\nWhere did you have in mind?\nOTTO\nThere's this Ethiopian place on \nWest 47th.\nMJ\nEthiopian. Wow. I've never--\nHe wiggles his long elegant fingers. Faintly but disturbingly tentacular.\nOTTO\nI like to eat with my hands.\nINT. MESKEREM ETHIOPIAN RESTAURANT - NIGHT\nA lovely server settles an enormous platter of doro wat and \nother fine and strange foods before them. Otto is delighted \nto see it. MJ less sure.\nOTTO\nYum. Look at that.\nMJ\nIt's very... colorful.\nOtto digs in. After a moment MJ tears off a piece of njera and joins in. Warily. Otto watches her. She looks right back at him.\nOTTO \nWell?\nMJ \nStrange but good."b"45.\nOTTO\nYou were telling me about your \nmother.\nMJ\nI know I was, and I'm sorry. Let's \ntalk about you. You seem like a much more interesting person than \nme.\nOTTO \nNot to me.\n(self mocking)\nNot right now, anyway.\nINT. RESTAURANT - LATER\nThey are sitting closer to each other. She's finishing a \nstory. It's supposed to be funny but he just nods, serious.\nOTTO\nAnd did you have a dog?\nMJ\nWhen I was little. Tasha. She--no. I am not going to tell you about my \nchildhood pets. That's enough. It's \nyour turn. Tell me about what you do. It sounds fascinating.\nOTTO\nI could describe it to you. But you \nwould never believe it.\nMJ\nTry me.\nOTTO\nI'll tell you what. Come uptown. \nRight now. I'll show you the lab. I'll show you the rig.\nMJ\nOh, I couldn't--\nOTTO\nBoldness in all things.\nINT. ANANSI PROJECT LABORATORY - NIGHT\nThe darkened laboratory. Machines softly interrogate one \nanother. KEY in the door. Slash of light."b'46.\nAll the lights go on as Otto ushers MJ in. She notices the \nrig right away. It hangs in its dock, a malign orchid.\nMJ \nIs that it?\nOtto is in love with the rig, of course. The way that a man might be in love with a ship, or a 1971 Chevrolet Barracuda.\nOTTO\nThat\'s it.\nShe gets that he has feelings for his machine.\nMJ\nIt\'s beautiful.\n(beat)\nIt\'s a little freaky.\nOTTO\nWell, I\'m a little freaky. You should probably know that about me.\nMJ\nOkay.  \nTHE RIGOne of its heads. The one with a somehow crafty expression in its staring black sensor.\nPOV - THE RIG\nAs Otto "comes out" to MJ.\nOTTO\nI am not like other people, MJ. I\'m \nnot like anybody you\'ve ever met. \nFreaky, yeah, I\'m a freak of nature. I taught myself calculus \nwhen I was nine. I was a chess \ngrandmaster at fifteen. I don\'tsay it as a boast. It was hell on \nearth. I had to fight every day of \nmy life.\nMJ\nI knew a kid like that.\n \nOTTO\nBut there was always that one pretty girl who also managed \nsomehow to be nice. I\'ll bet that \nwas you, huh?'b'47.\n(CONT\'D)\n(CONT\'D)\n(CONT\'D)MJ looks away, smiles.\nTHE RIG\nDeep in its sensor, a diode pulses. Now it\'s watching MJ.\nOTTO\nToday, I\'m all right with it. I\'ve \nlearned to embrace being a freak. I accept that I was given the gift of \nintelligence for a purpose. Which \nis this thing you see. The rig. Otto\'s Octopus.\nHe goes over to it. Takes hold of one of its hands. A touch of the bridegroom.\nMJ\nWhat does it, well... do?\nOTTO \nOh, it cuts hair.\nShe laughs.\nOTTO\nWhat does it do? It improves you. It makes you better.\nMJ\nYou mean it makes you stronger?\nOTTO\nStronger, faster, yes, but also \nsmarter. Much smarter. When I\'m \njacked in, I feel like my grasp finally equals my reach. I can feel \nmyself--expanding. Not just my \nphysical grasp but my mind, my heart, my soul. I feel enlarged by \nthe experience. And it feels right. \nHave you ever felt anything like that?\nMJ\nI thought so. One time.\nShe goes over to the rig. Slowly extends her fingers toward the nearest head. As her fingers draw nearer the diode pulses \nand we begin to fear for the fate of her fingers. Her \nfingertips touch-- the eye goes dark.\nMJ\nWhen you say "jack"...'b"48.\n(CONT'D)\n(CONT'D)OTTO\nThere are four shunts that \ninterface directly with my central \nnervous system. I wear it. But it's also wearing me.\nHe reaches up and takes hold of the latch, with its spirit level bubble.\nOTTO\nThis is the neural integrity seal. \nThe latch, basically.\nMJ \nDoes it hurt?\nOTTO\nThe system delivers a steady dose \nof pain blocking endorphins the whole time I'm in it. Which so far \nhas never been longer than a few \nhours. The goal is a permanent interface. Of course the idea\nof a permanent human/machine \nintegration makes some people uneasy.\nGranted, MJ's looking a little uneasy. Otto fingers the Latch.\nOTTO\nThe Rig is designed to seek to \nimplement a systems merger with the \nhost. Unfortunately, so far, my flimsy human tissue's not up to the \nchallenge. Not yet. We're working \non that.\nMJ is freaked, and fascinated.\nMJ\nSo you have, like... holes? In your back? Permanent ones?\nOTTO \nWant to see them?\nDaring her, a little bit.\nMJ\nNot really, but yes.\nHe turns. Unbuttons his shirt. Lowers it. Four black glinting \ndiscs in his back. Freaky but beautiful."b"49.\n(CONT'D)MJ\nWhoa! Okay. Thank you. Very nice.\nHe pulls up the shirt, rebuttons it, turns. Shirttails \nhanging out.\nOTTO\nIt's late.\nMJ\nIt is.\nA DOORBELL PANEL\nA FINGER scans the names. Stops at WATSON. Press the BUZZER.\nEXT. MJ'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT\nPeter's standing there.

He whirls, hears \nFOOTSTEPS, VOICES.\nMJ and Otto approach the building. Peter's face as he \nregisters the voices: alarmed.\nREVERSE ANGLE\nOn the front step as MJ and Otto approach. Peter's not there. MJ turns to Otto, carrying the big dark bouquet.\nMJ\nThank you. I had a really nice, \nreally interesting time. And thank \nyou for the flowers.\nPETER PARKERClings to the side of her building, upside down. Takes the single cheap rose from his teeth. Looks at it.\nOTTO\nSo, maybe it's out of line. For me \nto ask you this. But I don't want \nto make a fool of myself. Are you seeing Peter Parker? Because if you \nare--\nMJ\nNo. I was. But he wouldn't... He \ncouldn't... He just couldn't.\nOTTO\nIt's really none of my business."b"50.\n(CONT'D)But he looks pleased with the information. He holds out his \nhand.\nOTTO \nGood night.\nShe takes his hand, then plants a kiss on his cheek. PETER\nWatching the kiss. It's breaking his heart.\nMJ\nTurns and lets herself into the building.\nINT. MJ'S BUILDING - LOBBY - NIGHT\nShe presses herself against the door. Stunned at her own \nbrazen behavior.\nEXT. MJ'S BUILDING - NIGHT\nAs Otto turns and starts back across town. A skip in his \nstep. A cybergoth Gene Kelly. Feels like dancing with a lamppost.\nEXT. LAMPPOST - NIGHT\nAs Otto walks through its beam we notice a dark shape \ncrouching on the stanchion. Watching.\nEXT. SCIENCE BUILIDNG - NIGHT\nThe domed building where it all began for Peter. A shadow \nfrom the shadows leaps onto the domes. It's Peter.\nINT. SCIENCE BUILDING - NIGHT\nThe great central hall. It's deserted and dim. He walks \naround. Hears echoes of that afternoon a year ago. \nThe spider cages are empty.He looks down at his hand where the spider bit him, rubs it. \nThoughtful, then his face breaks. He sits down, buries his face in his hands. Chokes up.\nA WHIRR; he looks up, TINGLING.\nINT. ANANSI PROJECT LABORATORY - NIGHT\nPeter creeps down the hall just outside. We HEAR the \nunmistakable WHIRR of the rig.\nSERIES OF SHOTS - COUPLING THE RIG"b"51.\n(CONT'D)1) Otto lowers the Rig into position.\n2) The Rig watches, expressionless.\n3) Otto steps into the Rig. Engages the coupler. A WHINE of \nhydraulics.\nOtto reaches back to twist the Latch. Can't quite see what \nhis fingers are doing.\nHis fingers can't reach. Can't reach. He strains, grunting. \nGives up. Starts to press the decoupler. Then--\n--a 'pod reaches in for the Latch and TWISTS IT.\nOtto flinches, then lets go as blessed relief floods his \nfeatures. Sinking in. The irises of his eyes spiral out.\nOne of the 'pods reaches toward his face and, tenderly, \nstrokes it with steely finger.\nPeter, watching, GASPS.\nThe 'pods hone in on the sound at once, quivering. Otto looks \nover.\nOTTO \nWho's there?\nPeter steps out of the shadows.\nOTTO \nParker?\nPETER \nHi.\nOTTO \n(rattled)\nWhat the hell are you doing here?\nPETER\nI wanted to talk to you.

ANANSI PROJECT LABORATORY - NIGHT\nPeter sits across a desk from Otto. One 'pod puts on a CD. \nTwo others are busy pouring two cans of Coke. Peter eyes the 'pods warily. Otto taps at the keyboard of his computer.\nOTTO\nThe viral delivery system we were \nusing in the superspider project.\nPETER \nThat's right.\nOtto hits a few more keys.\nOTTO\nThat's why you came here.\nPETER\nWhat other reason would there be?\nOtto shrugs.\nOTTO\nHere. Yes, we were using a modified \narbovirus. Highly infectious in \nspiders. We replaced the nucleonic \nRNA with whatever we wanted to code for and the virus did the rest.\nPETER\nIs this arbovirus infectious in \nhumans?\nOTTO\nIt could be. If we had wanted to \nintroduce spider material into a human, I suppose we could just have \njust gotten one of the little \ncritters to bite--\nStaring at Peter. Understanding without knowing.\nPETER \nWhat?\nPOV - THE RIG\nIt watches Peter and Otto, pulsing softly.\nOTTO\nWhy do you want to know?\nPETER \nI'm just curious."b"53.\nAs Peter says these words: \nThey are processed by the suit; it subjects them to a\nVISUAL VOICE-STRESS ANALYSIS\nThe pattern is scanned and designated COUNTERFACTUAL.\nAN INDICATOR begins to blink on one of the pods.AT OTTO'S WORKSTATION\nThe ROUTER begins to blink in kind.\nON THE MONITOR\nWindows pop up, running archive footage of Spider-Man: climbing, swinging, leaping.\nAnother window: Superspider Inventory: 1 through 15. Number \n15 flashes: LOST.\nBut Otto's not even looking at the monitor; he doesn't need \nto.\nOTTO\nSpider-Man's a friend of yours, \nisn't he?\nPeter starts to play the question off.\nPETER \nNo, not a friend--\nOTTO\nKnow anything about him?\nPETER\nNot much. Kind of a quiet guy.\nOTTO\nKnow if he was ever bitten by a spider?\nPETER\nHe might have been. I wouldn't \nknow.\nOTTO\nWe lost a spider. If, by chance, it bit him. Is that what happened? And \ntransferred the viral genotrope in \nits venom...\nHe's advancing on Peter now. The 'pods billow and arc."b"54.\n(CONT'D)OTTO\nThat's great! It's a conceptual \nbreakthrough!\nPETER\nNot to him, it isn't. He's sick of \nit. That's why I came to see you. To see if there's any way to--\nOTTO\nWhy didn't he just come himself?\nPETER\nHuh? Oh, because. He's, uh, \nhorribly disfigured. Up close. \nThat's why he wears the mask.\n(shudders)\nIt's like, he has these little hairs all over him, and compound eyeballs. And the smell!\nOTTO\nUnfortunate. No way to control the \nprocess, I suppose, relying on a \nbite.\n(beat)\nHe could probably use one of these eventually.\nHe reaches into a tray behind him. Holds up a tiny ziplock bag with a speck inside. Peter leans in to look. A tiny bit of circuitry--a spider-mite of silicon.\nPETER \nWhat is it?\nOTTO\nIt's basically an immune system on \na chip. You seed it with a sample \nof the material you want to defend against, and it pumps out antigens. \nI call it a parity chip.\nPETER \nParity?\nOTTO\nEquilibrium. The Rig is so \npowerfully integrative that right now it overwhelms my own systems. \nI'm hoping to use this to boost my \nbody's immunity. \n(MORE)"b"55.\n(CONT'D)\n(CONT'D)OTTO (CONT'D)\nIn theory your friend could seed \nthis with some of his own \nspiderized DNA, implant it, and knock out the genes that are coding \nfor his spider traits.\nHe tosses the chip back onto the tray.\nOTTO\nThis is just a prototype. We're not in fab yet.\nPeter regards the tray, the little baggie. There it is. His salvation. His eyes stray up to:\nAN AIRVENT IN CEILING\nConveniently located just over the tray.\nOTTO\nI had dinner with Mary Jane Watson \ntonight.\nPeter looks back, caught by surprise.\nPETER\nOh. Yeah. I know.\nOTTO \nTerrific girl.\nPETER \nAgreed.\nINT. ANANSI PROJECT LABORATORY - NIGHT\nThe Rig is back in the coupler. Otto is at his workstation, \nasleep in his chair.

PETER'S ROOM - NIGHT\nPeter is wiping down the glass surface of the desk with \nClorox. We see: gauze pads, adhesive tape, alcohol, pipette. \nA hot plate with a saucepan of boiling water. A box of Morton's kosher salt. A bottle of vodka."b"57.\n(CONT'D)PETER\nYes! Everything's fine! Sorry!\nHe decants some of the steaming saline into a tube.\nHe picks up the pipette, scrapes at the inside of his cheek. \nThen he picks up the chip with a clasp. Smears the tissue against the chip. Drops it into the tube.\nHolds up the BIG NEEDLE. Jeez. Pokes it down into the tube, \nand draws in the fluid. The chip is sucked in along with it.\nHe stares into the whirling fluid in the syringe.\nSERIES OF SHOTS - THE SYRINGE\nIn its swirl:\n1) Spider-Man careens like a maniac through Greater Manhattan \nairspace.\n2) Peter Parker sits despondent in Otto's laboratory, head in \nhis hands.\n3) He crouches at the side of Ben Parker, watching him die.\nBEN \n(O.S.)\nI thought I'd taught you the \nmeaning of responsibility, Peter. At least by my death. That's the \npart of all this that makes me the \nsaddest.\nPeter turns. Uncle Ben is sitting on the bed behind him.\nPETER\nYou don't know what it's like, Uncle Ben. You don't know how it feel to be such a freak of nature! \nOkay, with great power comes great \nresponsibility. I get that.But you know what comes with no \npower? No worries. No guilt. No \nfreak show!\nWith his free hand he pours a shot of vodka. Tosses it back.\nPETER\nI'm not going to lose Mary Jane because of Spider-Man. I can be Spider-Man, or I can have a life. A \nnormal life.\nAnd drawing a deep breath he jerks up his shirt, baring hiship. "b"58.\nPops the needle under the skin. Squeezes. It hurts. A lot. \nHis eyes roll back in his head.\nINT.

He frowns, then leaps up into the air. Completes \na half-flip, and sticks feet first against the ceiling. Damn.He dresses with care, buttoning his neat civilian clothes. \nThen he goes to the closet. Crouches down, opens a panel in\nthe closet wall.

Ditkovich!\nHe gives an exuberant little kick at the bottom of the \nstairs. Loses his footing. Falls on his ass.\nDitkovich looks down at him. Peter's not even embarrassed."b'63.\n(CONT\'D)\n(CONT\'D)PETER \nWhat a klutz, huh?\n(grins)\nI need to use the phone.\nINTERCUT - PETER AND MJ\nMJ is doing yoga. In Downward Dog pose when the phone rings.\nMJ \nHello?\nPETER\nMJ? It\'s Peter. I-- I want to see \nyou.\nShe doesn\'t say anything.\nPETER\nI want to take you out. After your show. Tonight. I thought we could \nhave dinner. I\'ve made a few changes.\nMJ\nI can\'t, Peter. Even if I wanted to \nsee you. Which I\'m not totally sure \nthat I do. I already have plans.\nPETER\nWith Otto Octavius?\nShe\'s taken by surprise by this.\nMJ\nI don\'t think that\'s any of your business, Peter. Goodbye.\nShe hangs up, leaving Peter looking puzzled.\nINT. ANANSI PROJECT LABORATORY - NIGHT\nOtto\'s singing in the shower. The shower is actually a \nhazmat-exposure rinse. He towels off. Singing "Tonight" from \nWest Side Story.\nIn his exuberance, he is being WATCHED by the Rig. After a \nmoment he approaches the Rig. Reaches up to touch it.\nOTTO\n(just kidding around)\nYou jealous? Silly thing. You know \nwhat you and I have is special.'b"64.\n(CONT'D)\n(CONT'D)A moment of doubt.\nOTTO\nActually, I almost wish I could \ntake you with me. Don't feel like \nquite such a fool with you around. \nMust be the endorphin push.\nHe looks around. Peels off his shirt.\nINT. MARTIN BECK THEATER - STAGE - NIGHT\nMJ's on stage, singing. We do a kind of Citizen Kane rise up \ninto the catwalks high above the stage.\nPeter Parker dangles by a thread. Upside down. Listening as \nMJ's voice rises.\nINT. QUEENS HOT DOG STAND - NIGHT\nOtto and MJ carrying a couple of dogs apiece toward the \ncounter. It's very crowded. Otto's wearing his long coat.\nMJ\nThanks for indulging me. I know it's a long way to come for a hot \ndog. But these are the best.\nOTTO\nI've never been to Queens before.\nOtto stumbles. Two 'pods shoot out of the bottom of his coat and arrest his fall.\nHe rights himself, blushing. No one has noticed but us. He \ntakes a bite.\nOTTO\nIt's a very good hot dog.\nMJ\nI really needed it.\nOTTO\nI'm sorry the show's not getting \nany easier for you.\nMJ\nIt's like there's this pane of glass between me and the audience. \nThey can see me and hear me, but \nthey can't feel me."b"65.\nOTTO\nI don't agree. I think you're the \nmost marvelously expressive \nperformer I've ever witnessed.\nMJ beams for an instant, then cracks up, then looks at him.\nMJ\nYou're sort of gaga over me, aren't you?\nOTTO\nSort of. I hope that's okay.\nMJ \nI think so.\nOTTO\nI know we haven't known each other for very long. But I--\nHe winces, and reaches involuntarily for his side.\nMJ \nYou okay?\nOTTO\nBad back.\nThrough the plate-glass windows we can see Peter watching them from out on the street.\nEXT. STREETCORNER - NIGHT\nOtto and MJ stand a foot apart.\nOTTO\nSo what do you want to do, now?\nMJ\nI don't know.\nOTTO \nWould you like--\n(flinches)\nWould you like to come to my place? \nMy home, this time. Not my lab. \nI've been working on a Mozart trio.\nMJ (confused)\nYou have another Rig at home?\nOops."b"66.\n(CONT'D)OTTO\nWell, sort of. You see--\nTWO BIG BAD MEN pass. One bumps into Otto. Kind of hard.\nOTTO\nHey, watch it, man.\nThe BBM ignores him. Otto starts after, with those freaky \noctopus eyes.\nMJ\nOtto...\nOtto seems to rise up, weirdly looming.\nOTTO\nI don't know why human beings persist in believing that mere physical bulk confers some sort of \nevolutionary advantage.\nThe BBM feels a tap on his shoulder. It's a 'pod, natch.\nMAN \nYeah?\nThe 'pods snake out around Otto, fatal and alert.\nOn MJ\nShe looks fully as if the flesh of the guy that she's sort of getting a crush on has suddenly sprouted four steel arms. \nOtto and the faithful Rig make short work of the two men.\nOtto turns back to MJ, hanging in the air. Aglow with the \nwork out. Hurricane eyes. SIRENS in the distance.\nOTTO\nWe wanted to show you what we are.\nEXT. STREETCORNER - ANOTHER VIEW\nPeter is watching from a distance as Otto bursts out into \nstrange bloom.\nPETER\nOh oh.\nStarts to run toward them. Then stops. Looks around. Sees:\nEXCELSIOR SOUVENIR SHOP\nHe dashes in and looks around. Finds a Spider-Man replica t \nshirt. "b"67.\nGrabs it, and a Big Apple ski mask. Runs out of the shop with \nthe SHOPOWNER running after him.\nAs he runs he pulls on the long-sleeved T-shirt and mask.\nEXT. STREETCORNER - ON OTTO AND MJ\nThe arms retract and Otto comes to her, his clothing in \ntatters. She backs away. Turns. Tries to run.\nA 'pod lazily retrieves her. Whips her around.\nOTTO (plural voice)\nLook at us!\nShe meets his gaze. He looks tenderly at her. SIREN getting \nlouder.\nOTTO\n(normal voice)\nYou're so lovely.\nThe fingertip of the 'pod strokes her cheek with the same \ntenderness. Ick.\nMJ\nGet away from me!\nShe tries to duck free of the 'pod. He won't let go.\nSPIDER-MAN \n(O.S.) \nLet go of her.\nOtto turns. Sees Peter standing there. Laughs.\nOTTO\nWe're out of candy, kid. You'll have to TP the house.\nSPIDER-MAN \nPut her down!\nHe flies at Otto. Otto sidesteps him and, reinforcing his grip on MJ, starts to flee up the side of a building. On top \nof the building they start to fight.\nA leaping pursuit across the rooftops. Elevated tracks in\nthe distance. On the next to last rooftop before the tracks, Otto turns. The fight begins.\nIt's not a fair fight; Otto his hampered by holding MJ.\nOtto looks at MJ: reproach in his eyes. Then he sets her \ngently down. And leaps over to the next building."b'68.\nSpider-Man goes to MJ. She shakes his arm.\nMJ\nGo get him. Please. He\'s not bad.\nPeter peers at her through the eyeholes of the ski mask.\nPETER\nDo you...Do you love him?\nMJ\nHe\'s my friend. He\'s angry. And \ndangerous. Please, Spider-Man. Don\'t let him hurt himself.\nSpider-Man nods. And goes after Otto. Chases him across the last rooftop before the tracks. Otto hesitates on the ledge.\nSpider-Man flies at him headfirst. HITS and they both tumble \nover the side of the building.\n"TRAIN SEQUENCE" (TR)\nThey fall onto the elevated tracks that run alongside the \nbuilding.\nA train is passing at that moment. They smash down onto the \ntop of it and are carried along the rushing tracks.\nOtto rights himself. Gets to his feet.\nOTTO\nI\'m ready. Come on.\nSpidey rises and then it\'s basically a five mile long version of King of the Hill, at high speed. Or maybe the myth of Sisyphus. Otto digs at the head of the car, and Spidey comes \nafter him. And Otto throws him off, and Spidey comes after \nhim.\nEvery time he falls off the train, something worse happens to \nSpider-Man than the time before. It\'s brutal. But he always climbs back on.\nAt one point Spidey manages to get right onto Otto\'s back. He \ngets his hand in at the root of the \'pods and grabs hold of \nthe Latch. Pulls on it. It SNAPS and swings free. Still \nattached. But useless. And Otto HURLS him off the train. Spidey climbs back on.\nAfter the Latch busts, Otto just keeps getting stronger. But \nwe notice that Spidey seems to be tiring. He\'s winded.\nSo it makes Otto angry that Spidey keeps on coming. He knocks \nSpidey off again, and then smashes in the window of the car beneath his feet, reaches in with his \'pods.'b"69.\nHe starts yanking people right out and tossing them to the \nside. Spider-Man snares them all in webs. The last time, his \nwebbing SPUTTERS before it fires.\nFinally Otto rips the controls right out of the car. Then he \njumps off the train. Spider-Man wants to go after him.\nBut the train is now hurtling out of control. He can't just leave it.\nHe stays. And it's a good thing, because a big L-bend in the \ntracks is coming up. And the train is going much too fast to \ntake the turn.\nSpider-Man manages to get all the passengers evacuated to the \nrear half of the train.\nThen he gets behind the first three cars (now empty), right\nin down between, and cuts the lead ones loose. Gives them a \nmighty push. They race ahead, smash through the guard rail, and PLUNGE over the side of the elevated.\nNow Spider-Man has to stop the part with the PASSENGERS. He \njumps down in front of the car that's now the lead. Plants\nhis legs against the speeding track itself. Railroad ties \nSNAP-SNAP-SNAP and the momentum slows. But not enough.\nFinally, web SPUTTERING, at the very limit of his strength, \nSpider-Man strings his own body between buildings with webbing, making himself into the focus of a giant slingshot, \nwith all those tons of train shoving right up against him.\nAnd the train slows. And slows. And slows. And stops. The Passengers CHEER.\nUtterly spent, his makeshift costume tattered, gaping holes\nin his mask, Spider-Man hangs over the abyss, clinging to the \nedge, held in place by the tension of his webbing against the \nbulk of the train behind him. And then--\nAT HIS WRISTS\nThe webbing gives out. For good. The spinnerets FOAM OVER like emptied aerosol cans.\nHe hangs suspended for a moment. Then falls--And is caught, by the Passengers. Leaning out of the front \nwindows of the train.\nThey drag him back in and lay him on the floor. His mask is \nso torn and stretched that you can see more than half his face.\nThe passengers look down at him. Then AN OLDER MAN reaches \ndown and tugs the mask back over Spider'man's face. Looks up\nat the others: Anybody got a problem with my doing that?"b"70.\n(CONT'D)Nobody does.\nINT. ANANSI PROJECT LABORATORY - NIGHT\nOtto stumbles back into the lab. He's crying. He backs into \nthe coupler and activates it. It advances to a certain point \nand then stalls. Tries it again; nothing.\nHis hand reaches for the Latch. It's loose; he remembers in\nFLASHBACK - FIGHT\nAs Spider-Man BUSTS the latch while trying to decouple Otto.\nPRESENT MOMENT - LAB\nA glinting black 'pod joins his hand on the Latch. They are \ntogether forever now. A look on Otto's face of inexpressible rapture or possibly unbearable pain. He sinks to the ground.\nINT. ANANSI PROJECT LABORATORY - DAY\nEarly the next morning. One of the GRADUATE ASSISTANTS lets \nlets herself in. Wearing headphones, listening to the Flaming Lips. Nicest time of the day.\nSinging along, hangs up coat, turns on lights. Takes a moment \nor two to sense that something is amiss. Doffs the \nheadphones. Turns to look at:\nTHE EMPTY COUPLERCables dangling loose.\nThis pretty much freaks out the Graduate Assistant \ncompletely.\nASSISTANT\nProfessor Octavius?\nOTTOLies on the floor, naked, in the rig. Weird fluid seeping \nfrom the flesh/machine interface. The assistant goes for the \nphone, stabs out a code.\nASSISTANT\nThis is Gretchen McCord, in the Anansi lab. I need help. I need \ndoctors. A lot of doctors.\nAn ALARM begins to sound.\nINT. RESEARCH CENTER - CORRIDOR - DAY\nA special team of commando DOCTORS, extreme surgeons, rush \nalong, wheeling equipment and gear. They're like Helmut Newton doctors, packing in a portable operating theater."b"71.\nINT. ANANSI PROJECT LABORATORY - DAY\nConverted to an impromptu surgery. Otto lies on a table with \nthe 'pods wilting around him.\nThe X-docs go to work. They're wearing mirrored eyeshades and \nusing laser instruments. It's a complicated ballet of machinery and surgeons and blood. The ANESTHESIOLOGIST \nmonitors the EKG.\nDOCTOR 1\nJesus! Look at his tissue! It's \nchanging so fast you can see it.\nDOCTOR 2\nHis autoimmune function is breaking down completely.\nDOCTOR 3\nThe Rig's like a parasite...that's \ngoing to kill its host.\nDOCTOR 4\nUnless we kill him first by trying \nto remove it.\nThe pace of the EKG ratchets up a notch.\nANESTHESIOLOGIST\nI may need to give him a little more. So are we going to do this or not?\nThe doctors look at each other.\nDOCTOR 3 \nAll right. Come on.\nThe Anesthesiologist prepares to turn up the gas on Otto.One of the 'pods stirs faintly. Unobserved. It's diode pulses. Takes in the situation.\nThe surgeons take up their instruments.From the pseudpod, a soft WHIRR as we travel down\nINTO THE POD ITSELF\nInto its systems. Impulses sent to a fabrication unit. A \ncomplicated organic molecule takes rapid shape, then a dozen more like it, and we follow them back out of the fab.\nThe molecules are pumped directly into another system: Otto's \nnervous system. Up the spine, toward the brain. "b"72.\n(CONT'D)\n(CONT'D)\n(CONT'D)\n(CONT'D)A soft feminine VOICE wells up, muffled. Almost sounds like \nit's saying, Wake up, Otto.\nOTTO'S BODY\nWe travel up along his hips and chest, through his neck and \nup to\nHIS EYES\nThey snap open.\nOTTO \nI'm awake.\nWith a ROAR he comes to life. The 'pods windmill and lash and flail. A tornado or turbine.\nWithin moments, Otto stands surrounded by bodies. He's \nbleeding himself.\nThe servo of a 'pseudopod TRILLS softly. The other 'pods \ngather near it, and turn their attention as one on Otto.\nDarting, flexing, the 'pods go to work on Otto's wounds. One cleans with a swab. One secretes an ointment. One radiates a \nhealing light. And one pours him a glass of brandy. He knocks \nit back. Sighs.\nOTTO\nAll right. System report.\nHe appears to be LISTENING to a voice in his head, a soft feminine MURMUR we can almost make out. Winces.\nOTTO\nJesus, that's disgusting. How long do we have?\n(listening)\nI'm going to have to try the parity chip.\nHe goes over to the tray. Of course it's not there.\nOTTO\nSpider-Man! He stole it--or Parker stole it for him.\n(listens)\nNo, no time to fab a new one.\nHis VOICE thickens as he shift to the plural, as if another strand had been woven into it.\nOTTO\nWe need to find another means of attaining system equilibrium."b"73.\nINT. ANANSI PROJECT LABORATORY - CONTINUOUS\nOtto opens one of the X-doctors' portable lockers. Stacked \nwith their rubberized scrub-jumpsuits. Holds it up. Yes, it will do. The 'pods take it from him.\nTHE 'PODS\nGo to work modifying the uniform. A blade. A needle. A heat \nsealer. Then they hand it back to Otto. He holds it up; now \nit can fit around the rig.\nINT. LABORATORY - NIGHT\nOtto checks himself out in a mirror over a sink. Pretty \nstyling. He looks closer.\nHIS EYES\nColored storms race across them. The surface of Jupiter.\nThis won't do. He picks up a pair of eyeshields. \nElectrochromic lenses that darken at a touch. He darkens \nthem, then smiles at the man in the reflection: Doc Ock.\nOTTO\nNot bad for a dying man.\nINT. MARTIN BECK THEATER \xe2\x80\x94 REHEARSAL ROOM - DAY\nMJ is taking some coaching from a WOMAN AT A PIANO. Trying to \nfind around a thorny note in her song. The DIRECTOR of\nBride! pokes in his head.\nDIRECTOR\nMJ? Talk to you a minute?\nMJ looks at the Pianist. The Pianist knows. Looks away.\nINT. DIRECTOR'S OFFICE - DAY\nMJ's talking fast as he ushers her in.\nMJ\nBobby, I know I keep screwing up my \nblocking in the scene with the \ncouch.\nDIRECTOR \nYou've been fine.\nMJ\nI've been working all day with \nRenard--"b"74.\n(CONT'D)\n(CONT'D)DIRECTOR \nSit down.\nShe sits. He slides a box of mints across the desk.\nMJ\nNo, thank you.\nDIRECTOR\nTake one. It's a proven fact that \nit's harder to cry if you have a \nmint in your mouth.\nShe doesn't get it. Then she gets it.\nMJ\nWhen is she coming back?\nDIRECTOR\nTomorrow night. She's strong and in good voice, and she's all ready to \ngo.\nMJ\nWell. I'm glad to hear that. It was a great learning experience for me, \nand--\nDIRECTOR\nI'm glad you feel that way, MJ, I \nreally am. But, well, there's one more thing I have to tell you.\nShe cocks her head, curious, no idea what it could be.\nDIRECTOR\nPlease, have a mint.\nShe takes a mint.\nDIRECTOR\nAllie Black is going to take over as the Shepherdess. And as Mrs. Frankenstein's understudy.\nMJ's eyes fill with tears. She goes pale.\nMJ\nWhat? Why? Bobby, why?"b"75.\nDIRECTOR\nWell, I just think, and Howard \nagrees with me, that it would be \nbest. Overall. It's not you, MJ. It's the show. It's just not the \nbest fit. For you.\nMJ is in shock now. She nods, rises, heads for the door. Before she goes out she turns back. Being brave.\nMJ\nBobby, can I ask you something? Do \nyou think I have any talent?\nDIRECTOR\nTalent? Yes. And guts. Looks, too, if you don't mind my saying so. \nBut--\nMJ \nBut what?\nDIRECTOR\nNothing.\nMJ\nCome on. You'll be doing me a \nfavor.\nDIRECTOR\nYou seem to have a hard time opening up. Really connecting to \nthe audience. There's something \nbroken way down inside of you that you don't want to let out. Most \npeople don't. But actors have to.\nShe nods, bitterly. She knows. She slips out.\nEXT. THEATER - DAY\nMJ stands outside the theater. Bills are going up over the \nposters, next to the words DEIRDRE DUNN, that read HER TRIUMPHANT RETURN. It's raining. Maybe it's even starting to \nsnow. She just stands there, crushed.\nFOOTSTEPS. It's Renard, walking into the theater. He sees \nher, and then starts to act like he didn't.\nMJ\nRenard?"b"76.\nRENARD\nOh!\n(bad acting)\nMJ Hi. Hey. I heard.\nMJ\nI should have known. I don't know \nwhy I ever thought I--\nRENARD\nYeah, that's tough. I know how \nyou're feeling.\nSomehow not quite sincere.\nMJ\nNo, you don't. There's only one person who knows how I'm feeling \nright now.\nINT. PETER'S ROOM - DAY\nPeter is on the phone.

DITKOVICH'S HOUSE - DAY\nPeter comes down the stairs. MJ is standing in the living \nroom. They look at each other; he reads her sadness.\nPETER \nWhat happened?\nShe goes to him and bursts into tears. He holds her. Strokes her hair. She looks up at him.\nMJ\nYou're wearing your glasses.\nEXT. CONEY ISLAND - BOARDWALK - DUSK\nThey walk along the deserted boardwalk. Snow flurries.\nPETER\nThose guys are crazy, MJ. That's \nall I can say. I saw you. You were \nawesome.\nShe turns to look at him.\nMJ\nYou saw me? When did you see me?\nPETER\nOh, I dropped in the other night. You were fantastic! You put everything you have out there, MJ. \nEverything you are. Right up front. \nYou always have. That's what I've always...\nMJ\nWhat? That's what you always what?\nHe puts his arm around her. She leaves it there.\nINT. DINER - NIGHT\nPeter drinks coffee. MJ's eating a huge sundae.\nPETER\nI know what a jerk I've been. I \nunderstand why you got mad at me. I \nsaid I would always be there for you, and then I wasn't. \n(MORE)"b"78.\n(CONT'D)\n(CONT'D)PETER (CONT'D)\nBut I swear to you, MJ, things are \ngoing to be different now.\nShe rolls her eyes.\nPETER\nWhat? I'm serious.\nMJ\nWhy are things going to be different now? Because you started \nwearing your glasses again?\nPETER\nBecause--I can't tell you. But you don't need to worry about it, \nbecause I have changed, and--\nBut MJ's getting steamed.\nMJ\nYou can't tell me? You can't tell me! Peter Parker, if you can't tell \nme, if you can't trust me, then nothing has changed at all! You and \nyour little boy secrets!\nShe pushes away the ice cream.\nMJ\nCall me when you're ready to grow up!\nPEOPLE are staring. Timidly Peter raises a finger.\nPETER \nCheck, please.\nMJ\nIsn't there one semi-normal, grown up human male in this whole goddamn \ncity?\nThe WAITRESS brings the check.\nWAITRESS\nI hope that was a rhetorical question.\nPeter takes out his wallet. As he opens his wallet, he already knows what he will find in it.\nIt's empty."b"79.\n(CONT'D)\n(CONT'D)PETER\nI, uh, I need to get to an ATM.\nMJ, disgusted, yanks open her purse. Scrambles up from the \ntable.\nMJ\nYeah. Things have really changed a \nlot.\nMJ shakes her head, tosses down a twenty, walks out.\nEXT. MINEO'S PIZZA - NIGHT\nPeter approaches.

Tell me this, Osborn... How do I know that you aren't \nSpider-Man? Eh? Maybe this whole \nreward thing was just an elaborate dodge. And now that's things are \ngetting a little hot for you, you \nwant to call it off! Your father was a strange character, I always \nthought so. Maybe you're a little \nstrange, yourself.\nJabs that Jameson finger at Harry.\nJJJ\nNow go home, and leave the running of a public smear campaign to the people who really know what they're \ndoing.\nHarry grabs the finger and crumples it in his fist.

You don't know what it's \nlike to want revenge so bad you can taste it!\nHarry stalks out, brushes past Peter. Peter reaches out to him.\nPETER\nHarry? Harry, what's going on?\nHarry whirls, furious, about to strike. The wire lattice embedded in the safety glass of the partition casts a grid of \nshadow across Peter's face; it looks like webbing.\nHarry peers at Peter, fixedly, then turns and walks out.\nJJJ turns to Peter, sucking on his sore finger. Peter eyes \nthe costume.\nJJJ\nJesus, Parker, how many times do I \nhave to fire you?\nEXT. AUNT MAY'S HOUSE - DAY\nA sunny day. Geraniums. Otto notices the geraniums by the \ndoor. Rings.

We had an argument, I threw him \nout. I don\'t know where he is! And \nthat\'s the truth.\nShe\'s lying. But doubt creases Otto\'s face. May sees it. And suddenly fear gives way to something else. Anger. Pride. Will to live.\nMAY\nNow I\'ll thank you to take your \nhand off of me!\nOtto\'s surprised. So is May. He retracts his hand.\nOTTO\nWe will find Spider-Man.

And, now, here \nin the studio, we have JJ Jameson, \npublisher of the New York Daily Bugle.

A \nPOLICEMAN stops him.\nPOLICEMAN\nThat's as far as you can go, buddy.\nPeter steps back, horrified by the destruction. Peoplehuddle miserably nearby.

Ready to fire.\nCOP\nNo, you'll hit the girl.\nOck's moving incredibly fast. He steps right over the police \nline--and right over Peter. Peter runs after them.\nPETER \nMJ! MJ!\nMJ hears him--\nMJ \nPeter?\n--but Ock just keeps on going. Peter picks up a broken beam \nlying nearby and hurls it at Ock's legs as hard as he can. A \n'pod lashes out and flicks it away. Then lashes at Peter,too, and sends him flying.\nHe lands hard. Ock vanishes from sight.Peter gets up, looks around. Jumps into the Nynex truck. \nTakes off after Ock at top speed.

You'll be helping us. We promise.\nAs he speaks, one of the 'pods snakes beckoningly out. MJ notices, and she shudders.\nMJ\nOtto, who is we?\nGUNNING ENGINE. Here comes Peter, tires squealing. Otto snatches MJ up again with one 'pod. Rises up on the lower \npair. "b"97.\nAnd with the fourth, PLUNGES straight into the cab of the \ntruck and grabs hold of Peter. Rips him out and tosses\nhim aside.\nThe truck crashes against a lamppost and splits open. A \nbicycle chained to the lamppost goes flying and lands with a \nclatter. Peter lies amid spools of cable and orange plastic fencing. He stands up shakily.\nNow a HELICOPTER descends on the intersection. Squad cars \narrive from every direction.\nOne of the 'pods snakes up and grabs hold of the chopper's \nstrut. Another reaches right into the whirl of the \nhelicopter's rotors. His 'pod takes hold of the rotor shaft \nand with a horrible shrieking brings it to a halt. Then Ock hurls the chopper directly at the police cars.\nWatching the explosion, grinning, he retreats. He doesn't \nsee:\nTHE WEB\nThat Peter has improvised, from orange fencing, across the \nintersection. It's crooked and lame but Ock stumbles. Loses \nhis balance. SLAMS to the ground. One 'pod stays aloft, holding MJ. \nPeter runs to her, she grabs hold of him. He tries to pry it \nloose. No way. Now another 'pod snakes in and grabs Peter and \nbats him lightly aside.\nOTTO\nTell your friend Spider-Man I need \nto talk to him.\nThen they're gone. Peter's alone in the rubble. Defeated... and then, abruptly, grim. He goes over to the wreckage of the Nynex truck. Pulls out the toolbox. Opens it. Takes out a \nwicked needle-nose pliers. Holds it up. Should he?\nFLASHBACK - CONEY ISLAND\nThey walk down the boardwalk in the snow. A few strings of \ncolored lights. He puts his arm around MJ's waist.\nPETER \n(V.O.)\nI just want to have a normal life.

Then \nat the pliers. This is going to hurt.\nHe JABS the knife directly into his hip. Digs around. The \nworst SPLORCH imaginable results. His eyes roll back in his head. He staggers. But he holds up the bloody chip and grimly \nsmiles.\nHe looks around--needs wheels. There's the bicycle. A\nlittle bent. It will do. He takes pedaling after Ock and MJ.\nEXT. AVENUE - NIGHT\nPeter rides past LOOTERS, smashing store windows. A LOOTER \nholds up the television he has snatched.\nLOOTER\nHey, look here, I got me my eight-\narmed discount.\nPeter slows, watching, frowning.\nLOOTER\nWhat are you going to do about it?\nPeter pedals off, slows again, turns.\nPETER\nYou really should put that back.\nThe looter, incredulous.\nLOOTER \nMan, shut up.\nHis friends laugh.

Some other LOOTERS have descended on a SIKH man \nwho is defending his store.\nLOOTER\nYo, why don't you go back to \nBaghdad?\nPETER \nHey!\nEveryone turns to look at him. Peter looks down the Avenue. Far, far away, by the Flatiron Building, we can see the \ndancing glint of Ock's 'pods.\nThen LOOTERS fall on the Sikh man."b"99.\n(CONT'D)\n(CONT'D)Peter drops the bike, and runs into the midst of the gang. \nThey turn on him. The Sikh man crawls out of the melee,\nbleeding. The looters swell around Peter, kicking, stomping, \npunching. He goes down under the surf of men.\nThen, with an audible WHOOSH, the gang of looters FLIES \nBACKWARD. It's like a blossom blooming. Peter rises to his feet, bloodied but steady. The men come at him again but now \nhe makes short work of them, leaping, kicking, dancing.\nThe Sikh Man looks on, throwing sympathy punches.\nThe looters lie fallen around Peter. He reaches down to yank \nthe stocking cap from one of the men's heads.\nPETER\nAre you using this?\nINT. JJJ'S OFFICE \xe2\x80\x94 NIGHT\nJJJ is at his desk, on the phone.

Uh oh.A foot SMASHES through the wood, splintering it, and then Peter, stocking cap over his face, lands in front of JJJ's\ndesk. He goes over to the case, SHATTERS it. Reaches in and \ntakes the suit. Holds it up.\nJJJ\nWhat the hell do you think--\nPETER\nIt makes you look fat.\nHe fires a web up out of the skylight, gives it a jerk, and then sails out after it.\nEXT.

ROCKEFELLER CENTER - NIGHT\nHe catches up to him at Rockefeller Center and they fight, in \nthe snow, on the ice of Wollman Rink. MJ gets away from Otto \nbut then stays to watch.\nEach combatant gifted in his own way with power, agility, a \nkind of grace."b"100.\nOTTO\nNot bad for a couple of freaks.\nSPIDER-MAN \nSpeak for yourself.\nOTTO\nI speak for us both.

That is why I will win this battle.\nAnd he does. At last Spidey lies defeated at Doc Ock's numerous feet. Doc Ock picks him up, and grabs MJ. He takes \nhis cell phone out of his pocket. Coolly punches a number.\nINT. HARRY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT\nHarry sits watching the destruction on television. Clearly \ndrugged to the gills. The phone rings.

I \nsuppose before anything else you'd like to know who put your father in \nthe ground.\nHarry draws closer, fascinated. He nods. MJ hangs back.Otto reaches out and YANKS the mask off of Peter.\nHARRY'S FACE\nHorror. The memory of Peter and his father shaking hands. Of \nSpider-Man leaving the corpse of Norman Osborn. Masks begin to circle one another in his mind--the masks of Norman \nOsborn's collection, Spider-Man's mask--and one other, green \nand grinning.\nMJ \nPeter?\n(dawning shock and horror) \nPeter!\nShe runs toward the table. A 'pod lashes out and knocks her \nbrutally aside. Harry goes to her, sees the blood on her \ncheek.\nLooks back at Peter lying on the table as a great, spiked, \nvascular probe begins to descend on the torn form of his friend.\nThe LAUGHTER begins to sound louder in his ear and the probe \ndescends.\nHARRY\nNo! This isn't-- I'm not--\nHe stumbles to his feet, stoned and terrified, and lurches out of the laboratory.\nOck swings another fell-looking unit into place near Peter's \nhead. All of the 'pods are working in balletic unison to \nprepare the procedure.\nMJ stands. She sees a big spanner lying on the ground. Picks \nit up. Tucks it behind her back. Starts to inch toward Otto.\nMJ\nOtto. Don't do this. You don't want \nto do this."b"102.\n(CONT'D)\n(CONT'D)\n(CONT'D)\n(CONT'D)OTTO\nThere's no way to avoid it.

One extrudes foam \nonto it. The other produces a clipper-head.\nWith a few rapid strokes they shave Peter bald.\nOTTO\nNo, that's not true. We're looking\nforward to this death. You know what's interesting? Humans always \nthink of the killer instinct as \nsomething very primitive. A relic of the savage past.\nNow all the cruel apparatuses are in place. An urchin of steel spines, miniature 'pods, wriggle toward Peter's bare \nskull.\nOTTO\nBut the longer we spend at this \nlevel of evolution, the more we realize that that's just wrong. \nThink about it. Human beings have \nonly gotten better and better at killing over the last fifty \nthousand years. This is what we're \nevolving toward...\nShe's close enough, now. She raises the wrench, high and brings it down--\nZWIPP. A 'pod lashes around the wrench and jerks it from her \nhand.

Looking him in the eye.\nMJ\nOtto... hey? Look at me. Please? \nJust look at me.\nShe crosses to him. The arms strike, and come within inches of her face. She flinches but doesn't give way. Then takes \nanother step toward him. Reaches up. Lifts the glasses. Peers \ninto his wild, dying eyes.\nMJ\nI know that you're in there. I can feel you? Can you feel me?\nThe arms WHIRR and twitch, impatient as hounds at the end of their leash.\nOTTO\nYes, MJ. I can feel you.\nMJ\nOtto, you are not a killer. Your \nwork is not about killing.

Just for the sake of surviving?\nOtto points at Peter with a meat hand.\nOTTO \nYou love him.\nMJ \nYes. I do.\nOtto's at the limit of his control. All his systems breaking down.

Echoes and ghosts.\nHe wanders the empty rooms and halls. Draped furniture. \nCarpets rolled.\nClimbs the stairs. Stops at the door to his father\'s office. \nHesitates. Goes in. There\'s nothing there except--\nSomething in the corner. A small piece of colored paper.\nHe goes over and picks it up. It\'s a little, store-bought\nHalloween card. More ghosts. HAVE A BOO-TIFUL HALLOWEEN. \nOpens it up. \xe2\x80\x9cTo Dad, Love Harry." He lets it drop.\nNORMAN OSBORN \n(O.S.) \nAll right, Harry. It\'s your turn \nnow.\nHarry looks around sharply. No one there.'b'107.\n(CONT\'D) NORMAN OSBORN \n(O.S.)\nI want to see what kind of stuff \nyou\'re made of.\nHARRY\nNo. No, Dad. He\'s my friend.\nHe looks into the mirror over the mantlepiece. Norman is there.\nNORMAN OSBORNE\nIs he. Your friend. I guess that\'s why he stole your girlfriend. I \nguess that\'s why he killed me.\nHARRY\nDad, I don\'t know. I\'m not sure. \nThere\'s a lot I don\'t understand.\nNORMAN OSBORNE\n"I don\'t know." "I\'m not sure." Harry, you swore an oath! You put \nyour word, your money, your name on \nthe line! You swore to make Spider-Man pay. Now, make him pay!\nHarry\'s leaning his forehead against the mirror. It reflects only him.\nHARRY\nI swear. I swear!\nAs he says this he POUNDS the mirror with his fist. It shatters and falls. Droplets of glass rain down. And there on \nthe other side of the universe is a neat little room. A \nlaboratory of some kind. A command center. A haunt.\nHarry steps into that other world. Hanging from a hook is a \ngrinning green mask. He reaches toward it.\nINT. MJ\'S APARTMENT - DAY\nMJ lies on the couch. Her leg in a really big cast. Reading \nthe Daily Bugle.\nTHE HEADLINE\nWACKOS: ONE DOWN, ONE TO GO\nShe reaches for a squeeze bottle that is just out of reach.\nMJ\nPeter! Peter? I can\'t reach the--'b"108.\n(CONT'D)\n(CONT'D)\n(CONT'D)He's there. In his coat. Backpack on his back.

I have loved you all \nmy life, Mary Jane Watson. I just can't have you, that's all. The \ndanger, the uncertainty. The \nhatred. I can't ask that of you. You don't know what it's like. This \nis my deal. It's my destiny.\nHe nods toward the Bugle.\nPETER \nWhat's he saying?\nMJ\nHe's saying you're evil incarnate.\nPeter nods.\nPETER\nI'll call you tomorrow.\nHe goes out. She picks up the paper. Her face crumples. She \nputs the paper down. Sees his CAMERA sitting there.\nLumbering, in pain, she pulls herself to her feet. Grabs her \ncrutch. Hobbles over to pick up the camera. Then as quickly as she can to the window. Throws it open. Snow blows in. She \nsticks her head out.\nMJ\nPeter! You forgot your camera!\nHe's on the street below. He turns and looks up. Shelumbers out onto her balcony. We can see the divots that Doc \nOck tore out of the face of the building.\nMJ forms a quick resolve. Then throws herself over the side."b"109.\n(CONT'D)PETER \nMJ!\nHe darts under the balcony and catches her, awkwardly, but \nsure.\nMJ\nDo you know how amazing it is than \nI can trust you do that?\n(beat)\nYou were given a gift, Peter. I want to share that gift with you. \nAnd I want you to share it with me. You don't have to do it alone. I'll \nhelp you.\nPETER\nMJ--\nMJ\nWhat, you think police officers \ndon't get to be in love?Firefighters don't get to be \nmarried? That's crazy.\nPETER\nBut, MJ. This is just--this is just \nso much weirder than being a policeman.\nMJ \nIt is weird.\n(beat)\nBut you've always been weird, Peter Parker.\nPETER\nWait, did you say married?\nShe hits him, hard.\nMJ\nI already know your damn secret identity!\nHe looks at her. Then around. Then he carries her over to the building and, lightly, with just the tips of his feet, walks \nright up it. Hops the balcony and ducks inside with her.\nMJ \n(O.S.)\nDoes this mean I get to see the \nSpider Cave?"b"110.\n(CONT'D)\n(CONT'D)PETER \n(O.S.) \nThere is no Spider-Cave.\nMJ\n(O.S.) \nThat sucks.\nINT. MJ'S APARTMENT - NIGHT\nHe sets her back down on the couch. Puts down his knapsack. \nThen SIRENS. A lot of SIRENS. Peter goes to the window and \nlooks out. Face grim. Well, you asked for it.\nMJ\nGo. Go! I'll be fine.\nHe starts to peel off his shirt.\nEXT. NEW YORK STREET \xe2\x80\x94 NIGHT\nThe sky glows orange; flashing sirens. Spider-Man takes off \ninto the night. MJ leans out of the balcony as he sails away \nto be who he is.\nMJ\nYou forgot your camera!\nSpider-Man swings around a corner and straight through the heart of a burning building.\nPETER \n(V.O.)\nIt was a five alarm fire. Gas fed. \n300 firefighters. And the junior \nSenator from New York on the \nseventh floor.\nHe comes swinging out the other side, clutching a DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN and a YOUNG WOMAN DRESSED AS A MAID.\nPETER \n(V.O.)\nWith his lovely companion.\nHe touches them down gently. ERT techs rush over.\nPETER \n(V.O.)\nLook at that guy. Look at him! You \nwant to know the story of his life? \nNo choice in the matter. No way out."b"111.\n(CONT'D)Spider-Man sails back up into the roaring fire, toward a PAIR\nOF CHILDREN, snatching them from the flames. Doing what he \nwas meant to do.\nPETER\nDidn't get a single damn picture of \nany of it.\n THE END "b'SPIDER-MAN \nscreenplay by \nDavid Koepp \nrevisions by \nAlvin Sargent 4/18/2001 \nDavid Koepp 11/14/2000 \nScott Rosenberg 8/14/2000 \nbased \non the Marvel Comics character \ncreated by Stan Lee \xc2\xb7 \nand on a treatment by \nJam.es Cameron \nSHOOTING SCRIPT \nWhite - 10/11/00 \nBlue - 10/26/00 \nPin.k -11/14/00 \nYellow - 12/4/00 \nGreen - 12/18/00 \nGoldenr.od - 12/22/00 \nBuff -1/9/01 \nSalmon - 1/15/01 \nCherry - 1/22/01 \nTan -\n1/29/01 \nWhite - 2/5/01 \nBlue - 2/12/01 \nPink -2/15/0~ \nYellow - 2/23/01 \nGreen - 3/2/01 \nGoldenrod - 3/9/01 \nBuff - 3/22/01 \nSalmon - 3/28/01 \nCherry - 4/11/01 \nTan -4/3.2/01. \nWhite -\n4/17/01 \nBlue - 4/18/01 \nApril-18, 2001 'b"--~-: . ~ .:'.-> \xc2\xb7.\xe2\x80\xa2 .:\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7 * \n.. \xc2\xb7~: "b",.\xe2\x80\xa2 \n\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7.\xe2\x80\xa2 ~r \xe2\x80\xa2''it,\xe2\x80\xa2 \n.. \xc2\xb7.~. ,. i . . .\xe2\x80\xa2 .~ ~ .. \xc2\xb7~ \\:; \n; .~\xe2\x80\xa2 ~ ~ ...... \n. \xe2\x80\xa2 .. ~\xc2\xb7.\xe2\x80\xa2 ''.r-. 2, ,,'!'-:-\xc2\xb7 "b"0 2 2.

A bit of a tug of war. \nPETER\nTake that off, it\xe2\x80\x99s disrespectful. Spider-Man doesn\xe2\x80\x99t wear a cape. \nFinally Peter yanks the cape from Miles. \nMiles and Peter lie at the edge of the woods SCOPING IT OUT. \nBeautiful Zaha Hadid style buildings, a dream campus.

Step Five\n: \ndownload the important stuff, I\xe2\x80\x99ll know it when I see it, and Step Six\n:... I grab a bagel from the \ncafeteria and run.\nBACK LIVE\nMILES\nSo what am I doing?\nPETER\n--uh Step 7: You stay here, you\xe2\x80\x99re lookout.

Actually everything she said was bad, I was lying before.\n--The group below is EXITING. As they do Peter SPRINGS INTO ACTION--\n--Peter climbs out of the air vent and smoothly crawls upside \ndown along a ceiling duct and jumps down.

Are you okay?\nASSISTANT VICE CHANCELLOR\nNo!\nSpider-Man turns, sees Doc Ock approaching.  A tentacle GRABS Spider-Man and YANKS him away.

He stands there, shrugging like -- what now?\nNed turns to MJ:\nNED\nSo, I opened the wrong portal to the wrong Peter Parker.\nMJ\nYeah.  I guess you just keeping doing it until we find the real one.  \nWEBB-VERSE PETER\nOuch.  \nMJ\nNo offense.\nNED\nOkay...\nMJ\nOkay, you got it.  \nNed tries again -- swinging his hand in wide circles, as--                                                                123.'b"                                                                124.\nNED\nFind Peter Parker.\nWEBB-VERSE PETER\nWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the thing on his hand?\nMJ SHUSHES him.  Ned continues to gesticulate.\nNED\nFind Peter Parker. Find Peter \nParker!\nSuddenly, a PORTAL OPENS BEHIND THEM.  On the other side stands a FIGURE IN SILHOUETTE.\nThe Figure steps through the portal to reveal PETER PARKER \n(Tobey Maguire) from THE RAIMI-VERSE!  In civilian clothes.\nNED(CONT'D)\nGreat, it\xe2\x80\x99s just some random guy.  \nRAIMI-VERSE PETER\n(little wave)\nHello.  Um, I hope it\xe2\x80\x99s okay, I just came through this, uh--\nThe PORTAL CLOSES behind him.\nRAIMI-VERSE PETER (CONT'D)\nOh.  It just closed.  \nMJ\nYou\xe2\x80\x99re Peter?  \nRAIMI-VERSE PETER\nYeah.  Peter Parker.  I... I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen you two-- \nHe spots Lola.  She blushes and waves.

Webb-Verse Peter nods, impressed.\nNED\n(to Raimi-Verse Peter)\nWait, so you\xe2\x80\x99re Spider-Man too.  Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t you just say that?  \nRAIMI-VERSE PETER\nI generally don\xe2\x80\x99t go around advertising it.  Kind of defeats the whole \xe2\x80\x9canonymous superhero\xe2\x80\x9d thing.\nWEBB-VERSE PETER\n(sotto)\nI just said that.  \nMJ\n(sotto, re: Webb-Verse \nPeter)\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s what he just said.  \nLola points about the room, giving a long, passionate speech in Tagalog.  The Peters patiently wait for her to finish so that Ned can translate.\nNED\nMy Lola is asking if you could clean up the webs you just shot?  \nWEBB-VERSE PETER\nOh, sorry, Lola.  \nRAIMI-VERSE PETER\nYes, of course.  \nLOLA\nI\xe2\x80\x99m going to bed.   \nAs she walks off...\nNED\nNight, Lola.  \nMJ\nGood night, Ned\xe2\x80\x99s Lola.  \nWebb-Verse Peter starts cleaning up the kitchen, as Raimi-Verse Peter approaches MJ and Ned.                                                                125.'b'                                                                126.\nRAIMI-VERSE PETER\nUh, this might seem kinda weird, \nbut... I\xe2\x80\x99ve been trying to find your friend ever since I got here.  I just have this sense that... that he needs my help.  \nWEBB-VERSE PETER\nOur help.\nRaimi-Verse Peter nods in agreement.\nMJ\n...He does.  \nNED\nWe don\xe2\x80\x99t know where he is.  \nMJ\nAnd um... honestly, right now, we\xe2\x80\x99re all he really has left.  \nRAIMI-VERSE PETER\nWell, uh, is there some place that he might go that has meaning to him?  Like a place where he would go to just--\nWEBB-VERSE PETER\nGet away from everything?\nA glance of acknowledgment between the two.\nRAIMI-VERSE PETER\nFor me, it was the top of the Chrysler building.  \nWEBB-VERSE PETER\nEmpire State.  It\xe2\x80\x99s just... it\xe2\x80\x99s a better view.  \nRAIMI-VERSE PETER\nThat is a sweet view.  \nMJ\n(realizing)\nYes.  Yeah.  I... I think I know exactly where that would be.  \nEXT.

Yes, we\xe2\x80\x99re... you.\nRAIMI-VERSE PETER\nSorry... about May.\nWEBB-VERSE PETER\nYeah, sorry.

And if they die, if you kill them... that\xe2\x80\x99s on you.  It\xe2\x80\x99s not my problem.  I don\xe2\x80\x99t care anymore.  I\xe2\x80\x99m done.  \n(then, sincerely)\nI\xe2\x80\x99m really sorry that I dragged you into this.  But you have to go home now.  Good luck.  \nPeter reaches for The Box again, but MJ gently pulls it back.  She looks at Peter -- just hear them out.   \nRAIMI-VERSE PETER\nMy uncle Ben was killed.  It was my fault.  \nWEBB-VERSE PETER\nI lost... \n(voice catching)\nI lost Gwen.  My, um... she was my MJ.  I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t save her.  I\xe2\x80\x99m never gonna be able to forgive myself for that.  But I carried on, tried to, um... try to keep going, try to keep being the uh... that \xe2\x80\x9cFriendly Neighborhood Spider-Man,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x98cause I knew that\xe2\x80\x99s what she would have wanted.

I just don\xe2\x80\x99t want you to end up like... like me.  \nRAIMI-VERSE PETER\nThe night Ben died, I hunted down the man who I thought did it.  I wanted him dead.  I got what I wanted.  It didn\xe2\x80\x99t make it better.

Struck by their losses.  Their regrets.  \nTheir warning .\nPETER\nI want to kill him.  I want to tear him apart.  I can still hear her voice in my head.  Even after she was hurt, she said to me that we did the right thing.  She told me that, \xe2\x80\x9cWith great power--\xe2\x80\x9d \nRAIMI-VERSE PETER\n--\xe2\x80\x9dComes great responsibility.\xe2\x80\x9d \nThe three of them look at each other.  How do they know?\nPETER\nWait, what?  How do you know that?  \nWEBB-VERSE PETER\nUncle Ben said it.\nRAIMI-VERSE PETER\nThe day he died.  \nThe three Peter Parkers stare at each other, overwhelmed by this uncanny connection.  Bound together across universes by those words.\nRAIMI-VERSE PETER (CONT'D)\nMaybe she didn\xe2\x80\x99t die for nothing, Peter.  \nEXT.

A wasteland.He signals up to CAPTAIN. The boat slows to a halt. The man shoulders a small pack. He climbs over onto a ladder and descends onto the frozen edge of the pack ice.  He turns his back on the boat and starts walking toward the distant shore.The CAPTAIN stares at the receding figure, expressionless. He pushes the throttle forward and the boat moves on.EXT. GLACIER EDGE - DAYSmall in the frame the man trudges resolute toward nothing. The wind starting to whip up. He climbs through the maze of ice and rock to reach the plateau of the glacier.

Incomprehensibly he leaves the pack behind.EXT. PLATEAU OF THE GLACIER - DAYThe man has been walking a long time.  He stops and looks around.  Ice. Mountains behind.

He stares forward at nothing, gathering his will.  And now we see the GUN in his waistband.  His hand takes it and points it down and into the snow but he stares ahead.  His thumb PULLS THE HAMMER BACK and the heartbeat starts to race.  From behind and to the side a bit: THE DULL PULSE OF A GREENISH GLOW IN THE BASE OF HIS SKULL, beneath the edge of his cap. EYES: flaring wide snapping from blue to DEEP GLOWING GREEN.

I\xe2\x80\x99ll confess something to you if you\xe2\x80\x99ll clear up some things for me...First, I confess, as a man...as Betty\xe2\x80\x99s lover... that I have always hoped you were dead. Not because I didn\xe2\x80\x99t like you but because I love Betty and I\xe2\x80\x99ve known that unless you were really gone, or she believed you were, that there would always be three of us in this relationship.  I\xe2\x80\x99ve dreaded the thought of you walking through the door. But now that you\xe2\x80\x99re here...I have to admit that I\xe2\x80\x99m very happy about it.  Because I\xe2\x80\x99m also a psychiatrist. And I\xe2\x80\x99m very committed to putting light into dark corners, so to speak, and I\xe2\x80\x99m very good at finding my way into the places people hide their secrets. I do it primarily because I think it helps them but also frankly because I\xe2\x80\x99m interested in what people have to hide. Betty has a very dark corner that I have never found my way into, despite considerable, careful effort. And the only thing I know about her dark place is that you are in it.  And I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if you\xe2\x80\x99ll be honest enough to tell me: why are you something that she won\xe2\x80\x99t talk about? This is said simply, directly...without threat or malice.BANNERThere are...aspects of my personality that I can\xe2\x80\x99t control.

Soft, yet strong.\nWOMAN\xe2\x80\x99S VOICE (V.O.)\nBefore Kofun, before Asuka, there \nwas the age of Jomon... The darkest \ndays in a remote island kingdom.  \nBefore it was called Japan...  \nA PRIMAL SCREAM takes us to: \nEXT. RAIN-SWEPT RICE PADDY - DAY\nNot the Japan you imagined.  We are in her dark ages,        \nin the midst of a savage tribal war.  \nWARRIORS are draped in primitive animal hides with a \nthick outer layer of finely woven grass to shed the \npounding rain.  Faces are marked with war-paint.  \nWeapons are iron and combat in clumsy with the \nbattlefield under two feet of water.  \nCasualties are high.\nVOICE (V.O.)\nThere was no Emperor then.  No \nshogun, no Samurai.  Only rival \nwarrior clans, fighting over food, \nland and religion... But two \nparticular clans, their names lost \nto history, fought only for blood.  \nEXT. BAMBOO FOREST - CLEARING - DAY\nDIFFERENT CLANS. A different kind of battle. The \ndress is lighter - weapons sophisticated, fighting \ntechniques refined. War-paint has given way to \ncolored sashes. One side wears RED, the other BLACK. \nON ONE SIDE OF THE CLEARING WE FIND: THE RED WARLORD, \na polished volcanic stone around his neck, watching \nthe merciless fight with cold, unblinking eyes.  \nVOICE (V.O.)\nIt was a feud so old its reasons \ncould not be remembered - so bitter \nits wounds could never be healed.  \nThe only objective... revenge. \nACROSS THE CLEARING: THE BLACK WARLORD, a strand of \ngreen pears around his neck, calmly looks on.  'b'EXT. RICE PADDY - DAY\nThe sky clear, the war over.  Peasants plant rice.  \nVOICE (V.O.)\nMost clans would find an uneasy \npeace.  They flourished and grew, \nplanting the seeds of what would \none day be Japan. But for some...\nEXT. OPEN FIELD - NIGHT\nThe Red and Black clans clash again.  Flaming arrows \nfill the air, providing the only light. The fighting \nis graceful, precise, perfect...\nVOICE (V.O.)\nKilling was all they knew. And they \nrefined it to a high art.... Until \nit was clear to all that neither \nside would ever defeat the other.  \nEXT. BAMBOO FOREST - CLEARING - NIGHT\nAn ominous orange light.

Then they charge. \nTheir men watch the fight with cold, unblinking eyes.  \nVOICE (V.O.)\nThe winner claimed victory in a war \nas old as time.\nThe Black Warlord stands into frame, a bloody blade \nin his hand.

Lonely. Isolated. \nAN EAGLE drifts into frame, eyes sharp, head ticking \nleft, right, center, left again - then diving. We \nfollow and emerge from the clouds TO REVEAL: \nA brilliant green mountain valley one thousand feet \nbelow, snow-capped peaks on either side. We are one \nwith the eagle, adrift on the wind, living only for \nthe hunt. We fly lower, faster - skimming snow, \nrocks, evergreens, A MAN IN WELL-WORN LEATHER.  \nBlink.\nAND NOW WE\xe2\x80\x99RE WITH THE MAN. But he\xe2\x80\x99s only a man for \nlack of a better word. He barely glances at the eagle \nflying past his head, the bird wondering how the Man \ncame to be here. Much like the Man himself.  \nThe Man squats, knuckles in the soil - primal - his \nthick black hair framing an unshaven face. He is un-\nphased by his proximity to a sheer, three hundred \nfoot drop. He studies an animal track between his \nfeet - wider than his two wide hands placed side-by-\nside - Five toes, long claws. The animal is a giant.  \nHe stands slowly, holding up a shred of brightly- \ncolored nylon clotted with blood and hair...  \nThe Man hears something we can\xe2\x80\x99t, smells something we \ndon\xe2\x80\x99t, follows his keen senses toward his quarry. We \nnotice he is strangely equipped for a remote mountain \ntrek. Boots, jeans, a leather jacket. No pack, no \nheavy weather gear. No weapons that we can see...\nThe sound of hard, steady wind takes us to: \nINT.

CAVE - DAY \nHe looks into the blackness - buffeted by the wind, \nnoting claw marks on the cold rocks. His sharp eyes \nadjust, making out the empty sockets of a cleanly \npeeled human skull. The wind suddenly stops, changes \ncourse. The Man sniffs, turns, too late. 6.'b'WHACK- He is struck across the face. He lands on his \nback across a sharp boulder, head bleeding. A mass of \nclaws backed by a gaping mouth filled with  teeth \ndescends. He rolls, screaming as his dislocated arm \ntwists. The beast slams into the boulder, dislodging \nit from the gravel bed. Then we see the animal whole.  \nA GRIZZLY - fur matted and rank, muscle caked with \nblood, breathing strained, other-worldly. An arrow \nis lodged in the animal\xe2\x80\x99s spine. \nThe bear lunges with surprising speed, shoving the \nrock as it stands upright - eleven feet fall, \nhowling. The rock slides toward the steep drop as: \nThe Man scrambles to his feet, dazed - painfully \nwrenching his dislocated arm back into its socket, \nholding his partially detached scalp in place. \nThe ground beneath him gives way and he tumbles down \na steep gravel slope, sliding toward a thick fallen \nredwood bristling with sharp, broken branches. The \nlarge boulder tumbles after him...\nWHAM- The man hits the tree hard, inches from being \nimpaled. The boulder skids down the slope behind him - \nSHHHHHHHHHHHWHAM - pinning his legs to the tree. He \nhowls in pain, cries in vain to lift the tree. Then a \nnew shower of stones behind him. The bear is coming. \nThe Grizzly slides down the slope in a hail of rocks \nand debris right for the Man\xe2\x80\x99s back.  He tries to turn \nand face the attack, but the rock won\xe2\x80\x99t let him. \nWith no other choice, The Man arches himself backward \nover the rock, wrenching his smashed legs, sucking up \nbuckets of pain. The world upside down now, he \nextends his arms as if to embrace the bear. And then: \nSCHICK- Three gleaming, ten-inch blades extend from \nbetween the knuckles on both hands. In another \nuniverse, this would be inexplicable. In the world of \nLogan, of Wolverine, this is a day at the office.  \nHe braces for the impact of 1000 pounds of screaming \nmeat. Given the circumstances, he screams as well.\nWHITE\nA helicopter roars across the sky bearing the \nslightly dated rainbow striping of the very dated:\nROYAL CANADIAN MOUNTED POLICE.  7.'b'EXT.

I\xe2\x80\x99d like a word \nwith him. 2-6-2 out. \nHe walks, his men follow - past the rock, past the \ntree; hacked in half as if by rabid beavers. Drag \nmarks and hand prints in the dirt tell a story: \nA man with three blades in each hand pulled himself \ntoward the nearby river. Then signs of these blades \nvanish. The drag marks stop and foot-prints appear, \ntelling us this man managed to find his feet. The \nfootprints lead into the river. The story ends.  \nYOUNG MOUNTIE\nWhat\xe2\x80\x99s this about a hunter, Sarge?\nSQUARE JAW\nLast night a fella comes up to the \nNorth Barracks. On foot . No gear. \nNo gun. Smoking a cigar, if you can \nimagine. Heard we had a rogue bear \non our hands. Told the dispatcher \nit would take us weeks to find it. \nSaid he could track it in a day. \nDispatch asks him how he figures on \nfinding a half-crazed man-eating \nbear in the high country all by \nhimself. This character with the \ncigar says: \xe2\x80\x98Cuz I understand it.\xe2\x80\x99\nAnd now the Mounties wonder if something worse than a \nman-eating bear could be out there. \nEXT. WOODS - DAY\nLogan squats hidden by the trees, watching the \nMounties across the river. He shivers, soaking wet, \nhis wounds gone. He pulls a three inch long splinter \nfrom his hand, dropping it in a pile of several more. \nThe gash it leaves heals before our very eyes.  \nHe picks up an arrow with distinctly colored flights \ntaken from the bear\xe2\x80\x99s spine. The tip is a broad-head \nwith a cruel hollow point, dripping amber liquid.  \nLogan turns the arrow over again and smells the \nflights. Then he stands and walks into the woods.  9.'b'EXT. ROAD HOUSE - DUSK \nEighteen wheelers roar through cold rain under an \nangry gray sky. Logan crosses the highway toward a \nbattered road house offering beer and bait in neon.  \nHe wanders through the mud-clotted pick-up trucks \nparked out front, breathing deep and slow through his \nnose. He stops at a truck with deer antlers in the \ngrill, a wolf\xe2\x80\x99s tail on the antenna. In back he spies \na bow and a quiver of arrows, the flights familiar.  \nINT. ROAD HOUSE - NIGHT\nFrench Canadian country music - if you can imagine \nsuch a thing - in a smoky room filled with TRUCKERS, \nLOGGERS and HUNTERS - forty men al told. None small. \nOn the muted TV we see the RCMP around a redwood cut \nclean in half, a rock and two white sheets. The \nscroll tells of five missing campers, a rogue bear \nand how the Mounties shot the animal dead.  \nLogan, dirty, wet, brooding, walks along the bar, \nbreathing deep and slow through his nose. He pauses \nbehind one man in particular.  A DEEP SWIGGING MEATY \nCANUCK in a greasy orange hunting cap. Logan drops \nthe arrow on the bar in front of him. Pause.  \nMEATY CANUCK\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s a poison broad-head, mister. \nThey\xe2\x80\x99re illegal.\nLOGAN\nAsk me where I found it.\nMEATY CANUCK\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t care.\nLOGAN\nIn a bear. Up the back country. \nSeems whatever fat slop shot that \nanimal didn\xe2\x80\x99t have the wind or the \nskill to track it down proper and \nfinish it off. \nThe meaty Canuck glances up at the TV.\nLOGAN (CONT\xe2\x80\x99D)\nAnd instead of dropping a lethal \ndose, this arrow bled poison into \nthat bear for days. Made him crazy. \nKilled five people. 10.'b'MEATY CANUCK\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s unfortunate.\nLOGAN\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s murder. Five counts... for \nthe man who shot that arrow.\nMEATY CANUCK\n(half turning, glaring)\nAnd you think that\xe2\x80\x99s my arrow?\nLOGAN\nI knowit is. And I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna hear \nyou tell it to the Mounties.  \nLogan puts a hand on the Canuck\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder. The \nCanuck throws a punch - his hand full of beer-mug. \nCRUNCH- Logan staggers back, covering his face. The \nCanuck spins, ready to fight. He freezes. Confused.  \nLogan\xe2\x80\x99s hand covers what must be a pretty bad wound. \nBut when he wipes off the blood, there\xe2\x80\x99s only a small \ncut on his face. He rolls tongue n cheek and a piece \nof glass pops out. The Canuck watches it fall to the \nfloor. When he looks back at Logan, the cut is gone.  \nLOGAN (CONT\xe2\x80\x99D)\nLet me show you how it works.\nWHAM- Logan drives his right fist into the Canuck\xe2\x80\x99s \ngut. He doubles over into Logan\xe2\x80\x99s left fist, held \nanvil-steady. The Canuck collapses, jaw broken.  \nLOGAN (CONT\xe2\x80\x99D)\nNow heal.\n(as the Canuck tries to crawl)\nYeah, I guess you could read that \ntwo ways. What I meant was- \nWHACK - A pool cue hits Logan across the back of the \nhead. He merely winces and turns.\nA BIG LOGGER, holding a broken cue like this is a \njoke on him. Logan sighs, calms himself. \nLOGAN (CONT\xe2\x80\x99D)\nNow I don\xe2\x80\x99t want any trouble. This \nis between me and him, not - \nEVERY MAN IN THE BAR stands.  \nLOGAN (CONT\xe2\x80\x99D)\n... All of you.11.'b'A BIGGER LOGGER steps up, holding up a baseball bat.  \nBIGGER LOGGER\nLet\xe2\x80\x99s see you break thi-\nSCHLICK-SMACK - Logan\xe2\x80\x99s claws flash through the bat. \nIn the same motion, he punches - his claws retracting \nan instant before he connects with the Logger\xe2\x80\x99s jaw.  \nCRUNCH - And we\xe2\x80\x99re off. Loggers, Truckers, and \nHunters, fueled by liquid courage, rush him in waves. \nThe fight is without grace, without choreography. A \nclose-in 40-to-1 head-busting brawl. Then 30... 20. \nCLOSE ON: A MASSIVE LOGGER by the back door, wisely \nwatching, waiting. He\xe2\x80\x99s fondling an axe.  \nThe last man falls. Logan is a bruised and swollen \nmess - his ability to heal taxed to its limit. He \nsees the Massive Logger coming, winding up his axe.  \nLogan staggers back, arms too spent for defense. But \nhe won\xe2\x80\x99t surrender. He lunges with a howl. The Logger \nside-steps and sticks his foot out. Logan trips, \ndents the edge of the bar with his head and hits the \nfloor face down. The Massive Logger places a foot on \nLogan\xe2\x80\x99s back rests the axe on Logan\xe2\x80\x99s neck.\nMASSIVE LOGGER\nSmaller chunks for th\xe2\x80\x99wood-chipper.\nHe raises the axe and: \nVOICE (O.S.)\nDROP IT.\nANGLE ON: Square Jaw and his Mounties in the doorway, \nguns drawn. \nBLACK\nNo sound. A bright flash. Sparks. We are looking down \nat a vaguely human form submerged in a tank of water - \na liquid casket. Red-hot, molten metal pours from \nbehind us into the water. An explosion of steam, \nimages strobing like snapshots, a fast-moving flip-\nbook of war and anguish, peppered with the presence \nof a woman, her face hidden by a shadow here, long \nhair there. Her back is to us, walking down a \nwindswept beach. Then Logan is holding her in his \narms, wailing in anguish at the sky, her body limp.  12.'b'Logan opens his eyes. He does not gasp or cry out. He \nsimply... exhales, trembling slightly, subtly \nbetraying his fear of sleep. He looks to his left.  \n40 battered and beaten Loggers, Truckers and Hunters \nare pressed against a wall of steel bars, staring at \nhim in mute fascination. PULL BACK TO REVEAL: \nINT. JAIL CELL - NIGHT\nLogan is seated alone in a holding cell wearing leg \nirons, his wrists chained to his waist. The men from \nthe bar are in the adjacent cell. Perhaps for Logan\xe2\x80\x99s \nsafety. Perhaps for their own.  \nThe last of Logan\xe2\x80\x99s injuries heal slowly but visibly. The \nCanadians stare in mute fascination.\nLOGAN\nBoo.\nAll 40 tough, hardened men flinch and step back. \nLogan smiles. A beat later and the cellblock door \nopens. Square Jaw enters, followed by THREE MOUNTIES \nWITH SHOTGUNS aimed at Logan through the bars.  \nSQUARE JAW\nYou have a visitor. \nA DIMINUTIVE ASIAN MAN with horn-rimmed glasses walks \nonto the cell block. He wears a black suit and \ncarries a plain white envelope. He bows. This is: \nZEN\nMr. Logan, I presume. I am Zen. \nLOGAN\nYou certainly appear to be. Should \nI know you?\nZEN\nNo. But I have been following you \nfor some time. Your arrest enabled \nme to catch up to you at last. I \nhave arranged for your release \npending a few...formalities.  \nLOGAN\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s bully. What do I owe you.\nZEN\nI assure you, Mr. Logan. The gain \nis entirely yours. 13.'b'Zen steps forward, offering the envelope. The \nMounties tense - Square Jaw grabs Zen\xe2\x80\x99s arm.  \nSQUARE JAW\nJust... toss it to him.\nZen sighs, flicks the envelope through the bars. It \nlands between Logan\xe2\x80\x99s feet.  He bends but, of course, \nhe can\xe2\x80\x99t reach it with his hands chained to his belt.  \nSCHICK - A single claw stabs the envelope before \nretracting and bringing it to Logan. The Mounties are \nstunned, the men in the other cell mutter in awe.  \nLOGGER\nYou see that? I toldyou. \nSQUARE JAW\nI thought you searched him.\nMOUNTIE\nWe stripsearched him. \nThe envelope contains a sheet of thin parchment. Old paper \nfrom an old typewriter. As Logan reads: \nZEN\nI assure you, Sergeant, if Mr. \nLogan was a threat to you or your \nmen, he would not be sitting here \nnow. And you would not be standing.\nSQUARE JAW\nWho- What... the hell is he?\nZEN\nThat is precisely what I\xe2\x80\x99ve come \nhere to help him learn.\nLOGAN\n(re: paper)\nWhere did you get this?\nZEN\nFirst we must have an \nunderstand-LOGAN\nWHERE?\nLogan lunges, claws extending, slashing chains like \nribbons, Shotguns rack and aim. He chooses to stop. \nZEN\nI can help you, Mr. Logan. But \nfirst... you must help me. 14.'b'EXT. MOUNTIE BARRACKS - PARKING LOT - NIGHT\nLogan still reading that paper. We get to see it now: \nPROJECT: WOLVERINE\nFollowed by dense military jargon. \nMeanwhile, Zen and a mix of ASIAN and WESTERN SUITS \nshake hands with SQUARE JAW and some MOUNTIE BRASS. \nThings seem to have been worked out.  They disburse. \nZen walks over to Logan. He produces a cigar which \nLogan accepts. As Zen lights it for him: \nZEN \nYour hunter confessed. The police \nadmit they might never have found \nhim on their own. They are very \ngrateful. \nLogan looks past Zen to the Mountie Brass, looking this way \nwith suspicion and disdain.\nZEN (CONT\xe2\x80\x99D)\nBegrudgingly so, I admit. But they \nhave dropped all charges. With  \nthe understanding that you leave \nCanada and never return. \nLogan nods, stung, but used to it. Waving the paper: \nLOGAN\nIs there more?\nZEN\nAll there is to know. Who you are. \nWhere you come from. What was done \nto you and why. But I can only tell \nyou what little my master permitted \nme to read. The rest is in Japan.\nLOGAN\nJapa-Did you say your master? \nZEN\nHe is in Tokyo. A plane is waiting \nto take us to him now.\nLOGAN\n(laughing/turning to leave)\nListen. It\xe2\x80\x99s been great. Thanks for \nbailing me out. Maybe I\xe2\x80\x99ll \nsee\xe2\x80\x99ya\xe2\x80\x99round.15.'b'ZEN\nWe had an agreement.  \nLOGAN\nYou had an agreement\nZEN\nThey will arrest you if you stay in \nCanada. \nThat stops Logan in his tracks.\nZEN (CONT\xe2\x80\x99D)\nAnd you will have to comply. Or \nkill to maintain your so-called \nfreedom. You will continue \nsearching in the wrong place for \nanswers to the wrong questions - \nwasting your gifts on petty acts of \njustice. A vigilante, living out \nyour days like that bear - a hunted \nrogue. Like that hunter - an \nignorant criminal. And you will \nneverfind an end to your pain.  \nLOGAN\n(turning back/glaring)\nWhat do you know about pain?\nZEN\nI stand in the presence of \nHistory\xe2\x80\x99s Warriors. Witness to \ncenturies of combat, ages of \nsuffering - pursued by enemies he \ncannot name, grieving for a love he \ncannot remember. You are the living \nPrometheus. Compared to you...I\xe2\x80\x99ve \nnever even felt pain. \nLogan\xe2\x80\x99s face tells us Zen is pretty close.\nZEN (CONT\xe2\x80\x99D)\nBut I know the answers you seek are \nnot here. And while your body heals \nquickly, your mind never will. Not \nuntil you recover your memories and \nconfront them. Only then will you \nfind peace. A peace I can give you.\nLOGAN\nAnd what do I have to do for you?\nZEN\nLet me take you to my master. 16.'b'LOGAN\nIn Japan.\nZEN\nIn Japan. \nLogan sucks on his cigar, considering this with no \nsmall amount of suspicion, then he steals a glance at \nthe glaring Mounties across the way. He shrugs.  \nLOGAN\nFine. Take me to your leader.\nZEN\nMaster.\nLOGAN\nWhatever.\nAN EXPLOSION OF SOUND, a stream of blue flame.\nEXT. SKIES OVER THE PACIFIC - DAWN\nAnd a sleek private jet streaks eastward, away from \nthe rising sun over a dark and uncertain sea. \nEXT. TOKYO - NIGHT\nAnother explosion - this time one of unearthly color, \nblinding light. Our eyes adjust to a world of \nflashing neon and LED on buildings, billboards, even \nmany of the vehicles themselves - this place is one \ngiant, ever changing video screen.  The streets are \npacked with a steady flow of fast-moving foot \ntraffic, seemingly immune to the overload of \nsurrounding imagery. Everything shines. Everything is \nimpossibly clean. And everything wants you.   \nWelcome to Tokyo.\nINT. LIMOUSINE - NIGHT \nANGLE ON: THE REARVIEW MIRROR and a woman\xe2\x80\x99s cat-like \neyes, glancing at Logan from under a chauffeur\xe2\x80\x99s cap \nconcealing close-cropped hair.  \nThis is YUKIO- 26. More on her later...\nLogan and Zen ride in back. As the mind-blowing light \nof the city rolls slowly past, the TOWERING FACE OF \nKINDLY OLD MAN becomes ubiquitous. God-like. 17.'b'Whoever he is, he is part of the current media cycle. \nKeener eyes will note a faint scar on his cheek.\nZEN\nYashida-Sama. My master.\nLOGAN\nHe\xe2\x80\x99s big in Japan. \nHis smile fades, realizing the joke is lost on Zen. \nZEN\nYashida\xe2\x80\x99s family line is as long as \nthe Emperor\xe2\x80\x99s. He has given away\nmore than Japan\xe2\x80\x99s richest man has \nearned. His corporation has \nrevolutionized medical research, \nagriculture, education. His wisdom \nhas shaped our government..The \nmaster is Japan.  \nLOGAN\nWhen do I meet him?\nZEN\nYou will see him tomorrow. First, \nyou must. \nINT. PALATIAL HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT\nZen and TWO BREATHTAKING HOSTESSES escort Logan into \na magnificent, penthouse suite overlooking all of \nTokyo - room after room appointed in a careful mix of \nelegant tradition and ultra modern. In a city where \nspace is precious, it is paradise.  \nYukiostands in the hallway, her back to us, looking \nsharp and in a black two-piece suit.  \nThe 100 inch TV is on, no sound - so hi-def it makes \nreality look grainy. Old Man Yashida is still on the \nnews. A restrospective montage; photos with world \nleaders going back to JFK.Also humanitarian efforts - \nwater, medicine, food for the Third World. The scroll \nis in Japanese, thus impossible to read.  \nLogan ignores this, scanning the surroundings, moving \nto the mini (actually quite maxi) bar and choosing \none of ten different kinds of whiskey.\nLOGAN\nThis\xe2\x80\x99ll do.  18.'b'ZEN\nI live close by and am at your \nservice day and night. \nZen hands him a business card. Logan shoves it in his \npocket. Zen stares.  \nLOGAN\nWhat?\nZEN\nIt is customary to read the card...\nLOGAN\nNice...font.\nZEN\nIf there is nothing else you \nrequire...\nZen subtly gestures to the Hostesses. They bow and \nsmile. They\xe2\x80\x99d like to stay.  \nLOGAN\nG\xe2\x80\x99night.\nAn impressed Zen and the clearly disappointed \nHostesses bow deeply, backing out of the room.  \nCLOSE ON: Yukio in the hallway, stealing a glance at \nLogan as the door closes. For the first time we see \nher face and realize YUKIOIS MORE WESTERN THAN \nASIAN.  Perhaps hardly Asian at all.  \nLogan closes the door, bolts it, chains it. He takes \noff his jacket, ours himself a shot, stars at the \nview. Then he notices a low table in the center of \nthe room and he sole object resting on it:  \nA SAMURAI SWORD - very old by the looks. He admires \nthe weapon, picking it up carefully, exposing the \nrazor-sharp blade. He merely touches it and his \nfingertip bleeds then instantly heals of course. \nHe notices a chain of Japanese characters engraved in \nthe steel. One of them appears to have age-old dried \nblood in the grooves. His face suddenly changes. \nFLASH\nAND THE SOUND OF GUNFIRE TAKES US TO:19.'b'EXT. JUNGLE - DAY\nLogan\xe2\x80\x99s repressed memory. Somewhere in the Pacific of \nWWII, amidst A HANDFUL OF RETREATING CANADIAN \nSOLDIERS engaged in a running gun-battle, vastly \noutnumbered by the pursuing JAPANESE. We find: \nLogan, machine-gun in hand, WOUNDED SOLDIER over his \nshoulder. While Logan runs and reloads, the Wounded \nSoldier shoots and vice versa. Until: \nA grenade blasts Logan off his feet. He leads in a \nheap, his partner dead. The dense foliage around him \nshreds in a hail of bullets. The last of his squad \nnow, Logan runs as far and as fast as he can until:  \nCRASH - The ground under his feet vanishes and he \nplummets, landing with a sickening crunch. \nCLOSE ON: Logan\xe2\x80\x99s face twisted in a silent howl of \nunimaginable pain. PULL BACK TO REVEAL: \nHe has fallen face down into a man-trap filled with \ndozens of bamboo spears, impaled like an insect, \nspikes through his out-stretched limbs, his abdomen, \nhis shoulder. He is completely immobilized - unable \nto free himself. His claws extend unconsciously and \nwe notice they are raw bone - not metal. Useless.  \nHe can hear the enemy in the distance, searching. He \nstruggles to pull himself free, adding to his pain.  \nThen a SHADOW looms over him; A YOUNG JAPANESE \nSOLDIER - handsome, with dark, piercing eyes - rifle \nin hand. After inspecting Logan\xe2\x80\x99s predicament, the \nSoldier drops his rifle and draws a sword. He rests \nthe edge of the sharp blade on the back of Logan\xe2\x80\x99s \nneck, nicking the flesh slightly. He raises the blade \nhigh. Logan braces for the end...\nCLOSE ON: The cut on Logan\xe2\x80\x99s neck healing:  \nCLOSE ON: The Soldier\xe2\x80\x99s eyes widening. \nThe Soldier lowers the blade, cuts Logan\xe2\x80\x99s cheek and \nwatches it heal. A drop of blood runs from Logan\xe2\x80\x99s \ncheek onto the engraved steel - unmistakably the same \nblade he will hold in a Tokyo hotel room 70 years \nhence. The Soldier raises the sword and strikes.  \nWHACK- he hacks the bamboo pinning Logan\xe2\x80\x99s right \narm. Then he drops the sword in the pit. \nConfused but grateful, Logan grabs the blade as:  20.'b'The Soldier walks a few yards from the pit, listening \nwith a mixture of fear and fascination to the sound \nof Logan painstakingly cutting himself free. The \nSoldier slowly draws a secondary short sword from his \nbelt... waiting to face this unique enemy. Then: \nLogan leaps cat-like out of the pit, sword in hand, \npulling the last piece of bamboo from his shoulder, \nthe rest of his wounds already healed.  \nThe Soldier shouts in Japanese, demonstrating with \nhis short sword how Logan should defend himself.\nUncertain, Logan raises his sword and.\nCLANK/CLANG/SMACK - The Soldier charges, hits Logan\xe2\x80\x99s \nblade, slaps him with the flat side of his sword and \nis back in place before Logan can blink. We can\xe2\x80\x99t \nunderstand his words, but the Soldier\xe2\x80\x99s attitude says \nit plain: \xe2\x80\x9cNo, no. No. Do it like this.\xe2\x80\x9d \nCLANK/CLANG/SMACK - He does it again, smiling this \ntime. Now Logan is mad. He raises the sword, ready.  \nCLANK/CLANG/SMACK - Logan blocks the last strike, \nsimultaneously extending his bony claws - tearing the \nYoung Soldier\xe2\x80\x99s cheek. The soldier staggers back, \nstunned, watching as Logan\xe2\x80\x99s claws retract, swallowed \nby the rapidly healing skin around his knuckles.  \nTHE SOUND OF GUNFIRE turns their heads. In the \ndistance, JAPANESE SOLDIERS are the ones running now, \nchased by A WAVE OF BRITISH SOLDIERS.  \nThe Soldier knows he\xe2\x80\x99s doomed. He drops to his knees \nbows his head and waits for Logan to finish him. \nBut Logan offers the sword handle-first. The Soldier \nis surprised yet again by Logan. He takes the sword \nas he stands. Logan nods to him: \xe2\x80\x9cGo. That way.\xe2\x80\x9d But \nthe Soldier is torn. Ready to fight impossible odds.  \nLogan puts a hand on his shoulder - his eyes \ndesperate for the boy. \xe2\x80\x9cGo.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThe Soldier nods and runs to fight another day.\nINT. PALATIAL HOTEL SUITE - DAY\nLOGAN\nThe\xe2\x80\x99hellizzah-\nLogan wakes from a deep sleep on the sofa, rain \nbeating the windows. The sword is back in its stand.  21.'b'The door opens behind him. He inhales. \nLOGAN (CONT\xe2\x80\x99D)\nGood morning, Zen. \nZEN\nI trust that you slept well.  \nLogan sits up, sees the Old Man on the TV again, \nlooking at him differently now. \nLOGAN\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve met your master before, \nhaven\xe2\x80\x99t I? \nZen steals a glance at the sword and nods. \nZEN\nYour encounter left a deep \nimpression. He spent a considerable \nportion of his wealth to discover \nall he could about you. \nLOGAN\nWhat does he want with me? Why now?\nThe question seems to strike a nerve with Zen.\nZEN\nI will take you to him.\nLogan stands and a small object drops from the collar \nof his shirt, bouncing three times on the table \nbefore plunking softly on the carpet. \nEXTREME CLOSE UP ON: An iridescent, gray-green pearl.  \nZen picks it up with his thumb and forefinger.\nLOGAN\nWhat is that?\nZEN\nIt isn\xe2\x80\x99t yours?\nLogan shakes his head. \xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d Zen\xe2\x80\x99s blood runs cold. \nZEN (CONT\xe2\x80\x99D)\nDid you leave your room last night?\nLOGAN\nNever left the couch. Can we go \nnow? I\xe2\x80\x99d like to meet the old man. 22.'b'Logan heads for the door, opens it, waits.\nZEN\nMr. Logan... Unless you have \nanother explanation as to how this \ncame to be in this-\nLOGAN\nThe last lady who stayed here lost \nan earring. Let\xe2\x80\x99s go.\nZEN\nOr someone placed it on your person \nwhile you slept.\nLOGAN\n(scoffing)\nMyperson? Without waking me? Me? \nWho would do that. Who even could?\nWe suspect Zen might know the answer to that. For whatever \nreason, he\xe2\x80\x99s not sure to answer. Then: \nZEN\n... Mr. Logan.\nLOGAN\nZen... Enough with the oyster \ndroppings. Take me to your leader.  \nZen sighs, walks through the door.\nZEN\nMaster.\nLOGAN\nWhat you said.\nLogan walks out, shutting the door. We remain \nfocusing on the chain. We distinctly recall Logan \nputting it on. We don\xe2\x80\x99t remember him taking it off.  \nINT. LIMOUSINE - DAY\nLogan and Zen in back, the mysterious Yukiodriving, \na dreary rain spattering the windshield.  \nEXT. TOKYO STREET - DAY\nLogan and Zen emerge from the limo into a crowd of \nSOMBER JAPANESE MEN AND WOMEN and black umbrellas.  23.'b'As the only Westerner (wearing denim and leather, no \nless) Logan\xe2\x80\x99s presence is off-putting. But the too-\npolite attendees steal glances rather than stare. \nANGLE ON: THE LIMO across the street.  Yukio\xe2\x80\x99s comely \neyes follow Logan until she is distracted by: \nAn argument at the front door between THE DOORMAN and \nA YOUNG MAN trying to push his way inside. The crowd \ntries their best to pretend he is not there. \nLogan stares. The kid is a dead ringer for the Young \nSoldier he fought in the jungle.  \nThe Doorman shoves the Young Man down in the gutter, \nhumiliated. He gets up and storms off in a rage. \nThis is KENUICHIO. Remember him. \nINT. AUDITORIUM - DAY\nPeople remove coats to reveal MEN IN DARK SUITS, \nWOMEN IN TRADITIONAL JAPANESE GARB. Logan finds \nhimself in a room filled with rows of seats facing a \nstage draped in red velvet. He is on a receiving line \nat some high occasion for a very select group. The \ncrowd parts behind Logan and Zen. \nPeople bow deeply to A PORTLY, BESPECTACLED, MIDDLE-\nAGED MAN and his TEAM OF BODYGUARDS.  \nHe is accompanied by his CAUCASIAN SECRETARY - \nattractive, business suit - long, raven-black hair \nhiding one side of her face and glasses that subtly \nstir fantasies of the naughty school-marm variety.  \nZEN\n(whispering)\nBow, I said... Bow. \nLogan doesn\xe2\x80\x99t. The Portly Man gives him the once over \nas he passes. Logan does it right back, then winks at \nthe Secretary. She blanks him. Zen is mortified.  \nZEN (CONT\xe2\x80\x99D)\nThat man is Noburo Mori. Minister \nof Justice.\nLOGAN\nGood for him.\nNoburobarges to the front of the line and bows to \nthe only soul here more impressive than himself: 24.'b'A STANTLEY MAN in his 50s - his bald head gleaming, \nhis pale gray suit almost pearlescent. He is: \nZEN\nLord Shingen. My master\xe2\x80\x99s son. We \nwill pay our respects.  \nOn that stage, Logan spies a porcelain urn and a \nportrait of the Old Man with a black sash across it. \nLogan notes the staunch expression on the men, a \nwoman quietly sobbing, and it hits him.  \nLOGAN\nYour master is dead?\nZEN\nI never said he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t.\nLOGAN\nYou could\xe2\x80\x99a said he was.\nZEN\nI have followed my master\xe2\x80\x99s \ninstructions explicitly. If there \nwas a deception, it was his \nintention... not mine.\nLOGAN\nIf he\xe2\x80\x99s dad, what the hell am I \ndoing here? \nShingen bows to Noburo , stepping aside to REVEAL:\nA YOUNG WOMAN. The woman. A beauty cut from marble. \nThe sort you can\xe2\x80\x99t touch - but have to touch - and \nwill never, ever get close enough to touch.  \nThis is MARIKO.\nThe very sight of her hits Logan like lightning. \nNoburo and Mariko exchange a formal greeting. Mariko \nbows, missing the slightly leering look Noburo gives \nher. But Shingen catches him. There is a tense \ndynamic at play here that will reveal itself in time.\n(Note: Take a moment. Look over the faces on the \nprevious few pages. You\xe2\x80\x99ve met everyone who matters. )\nAs Zen and Logan move closer to the head of the line: \nZEN\nI am instructed to tell you one \nlast thing.  25.'b'Logan snaps out of his Mariko-induced trance. \nLOGAN\nLast thing?\nZEN\nYou are free to leave at any time. \nBut the knowledge you seek will \nonly be yours when you honor the \ngift you have been given.  \nLOGAN\nHonor the- What does that even mean-\nBut he is cut off when they come face-to-face with \nShingen. Zen leans in, speaks softly in Japanese. As \nhe does, Shingen\xe2\x80\x99s eyes shift suddenly to Logan. \nTo the mute of shock of everyone, Shingen bows deeply, \nshowing great respect. This leaves Logan eye-to-eye \nwith Mariko. What follows is one of those subtle yet \nunmistakable moments between two people instantly, \nmutually attracted - both unsure of what to do.  \nShingen straightens, obscuring Mariko and shaking \nLogan\xe2\x80\x99s hand.\nZEN\nMr. Logan. Lord Shingen. \nSHINGEN\nI understand you knew my father. \nLOGAN\nIn a manner of speaking. I\xe2\x80\x99m... \nvery sorry for your loss. \nSHINGEN\nHe was a great man. He will be \nmissed.\n(pushing away his grief)\nExcuse my poor manners. My \ndaughter, Mariko. \nShingen steps aside. Mariko bows gracefully - polite \nbut not submissive. As Logan stares at her: \nSHINGEN (CONT\xe2\x80\x99D)\nYou\xe2\x80\x99ll forgive me for saying so, \nbut my father never once spoke \nabout you. When you were mentioned \nso reverently in his will we were \nobviously intrigued. How did you \ncome to know him?26.'b'Logan hesitates. \nSHINGEN (CONT\xe2\x80\x99D)\nIt is an awkward question? \nLOGAN\nAn awkward answer. \nSHINGEN\n(smiling warmly)\nMy father and his mysteries. \nPerhaps after the ceremony you will \nbe my guest at my home. There you \ncan share as much or as little as \nyou like. I promise not to pry. \nLogan glances at Zen. Zen nods: \xe2\x80\x9cSay yes.\xe2\x80\x9d\nLOGAN\nI would be honored.\nSHINGEN\nThe honor is mine. I hope you will \nexcuse me until then.\nLogan nods, steps aside with one last look to Mariko. \nAs Zen and Logan walk toward the back of the line:  \nLOGAN\nWhat can you tell me about Mariko?\nZEN\nShe is to be married in three days.\nBeat. Logan is stunned.\nLOGAN\n...Married.\nZEN\nTo Noburo. \nLogan turns to look at the portly, high-and-mighty \nMinister of Justice.\nLOGAN\nThatguy? She\xe2\x80\x99s marrying that guy? \nZEN\nThe marriage was arranged by her \nfather. It will be a merging of two \ngreat houses. A powerful dynasty. 27.'b'LOGAN\nWhat does she have to say about it? \nZEN\nShe has a duty to her family. She \nwill honor her father\xe2\x80\x99s wishes. \nLOGAN\n(reassessing Shingen)\nAnd I was just starting to like the \nguy.\nJust then, A MAN WITH A PITTED FACE reaches the head \nof the receiving line. Shingen does not recognize him \nbut remains cordial. Pit-Face bows deeply - a bit \nmocking. Then he lashes out with a tanto knife.\nShingen is surprisingly fast, deflecting the blade, \ntaking a slash to his forearm instead of his throat. \nA WOMAN IN THE CROWD SCREAMS, igniting chaos as: \nLogan leaps, reacting on pure instinct as:\nShingen drives his good hand into Pit-Face\xe2\x80\x99s throat, \ncrushing his windpipe as: \nSEVEN MORE THUGS rise up from the crowd brandishing \nknives. They rush Shingen. BYSTANDERS PANIC, getting \nin their way. Shingen calmly stands his ground, \ncovering Mariko, as the FIRST THUG reaches him. As: \nLogan vaults over two rows of seats and crushes the \nFirst Thug\xe2\x80\x99s head under his heals, landing face-to-\nface with Shingen. The two men have an instant to \nmake eye contact. They share a nod and turn to face \nthe approach of six more knife-wielding thugs. But: \nSCHINCK - Logan has six blades of his own. \nMARIKO\nKuzuri.\nLogan glances at a stunned Mariko staring at his \nclaws, fascinated? Terrified? Shingen looks at Logan \nwith more than a few questions of his own.  \nThey have to wait. The Thugs attack. Shingen and \nLogan meet them head-on. \nDespite the use of only one arm, Shingen holds his \nown, dodging slashing blades and striking one-handed. \nShingen is a master, fighting with dignity and honor. 28.'b'Logan, on the other hand, kicks, slashes, brawls and \ncheats. Anything to win. Meanwhile: \nNoburo\xe2\x80\x99s bodyguards draw weapons, but the cavalry is \nnot coming. They whisk Noburo and his Secretary to \nthe exit. Logan sees this, more annoyed than angry. \nCLOSE ON: Noburo\xe2\x80\x99s secretary. She practically has to \nbe dragged out, lingering to study Logan and his \nclaws with fascination. Remember this.  \nAN EIGHTH THUG comes up behind Shingen. Zen leaps in \nthe Thug\xe2\x80\x99s way despite having no weapon. The Thug \nsends him back with a single punch and then: \nMARIKO STEPS IN FRONT OF HIM. The Thug stops, thrown \nfor a beat, unsure of how to handle her. Then he \ngrins, changing his grip in the knife. Ready to kill. \nSlap -Mariko BELTS HIM ACROSS THE FACE, stunning him. \nShe raises her chin, fearless. \nThe Thug\xe2\x80\x99s grin is gone. He swings his blade: \nTHUNK- Logan drives three claws clean through the \nThug\xe2\x80\x99s forearm, punching him off with his other fist, \nturning to take on another attacker when: \nYukio steps in his path, stopping him: \nYUKIO\nI have Shingen. Protect Mariko.\n(when Logan hesitates)\nGO. \nYukio draws a knife and follows Shingen into the \nfray, breaking knees and kicking asses. Logan grabs \nMariko\xe2\x80\x99s hand, spies the exit and goes. To his \nsurprise, this door flies open to REVEAL: \nANOTHER THUG - aiming a gun and pulling the trigger. \nLogan leaps in front of Mariko and TOWARD the Gunman, \nslamming the door just as the gun goes off.\nBA-CLANKCLANKCLANK - the steel door sports three \nshiny bullet-induced dents in front of Logan\xe2\x80\x99s face.  \nEXT. ALLEY - OTHER SIDE OF STEEL DOOR - DAY\nThe Gunman kicks the door, trying to open it. He \nbashes his shoulder into the door once, twice, \nbacking up and rushing for a third when: 29.'b'Six razor-sharp adamantium claws rupture the door, \npointing straight out. The Gunman can\xe2\x80\x99t stop. \nINT. AUDITORIUM - DAY\nCLOSE ON: Logan, knuckles pressed to the steel door. \nWHAM- something hits the other side of the door \nhard. Then silence. His claws retract and he opens \nthe door, grabbing Mariko and stepping over what we \nassume is the Gunman lying out of frame.  \nEXT. ALLEY - DAY\nThe rain is pouring now. Up the alley, Logan sees the \nlimos at the front of the building and SEVERAL POLICE \nCARS ARRIVING. He leads Mariko that way until:\nGUNFIRE. GUNMEN emerge from PARKED CARS and engage \nthe police. The street is suddenly a wild-west show. \nLogan turns, pulling Mariko the other way when: \nSCHLING-SLICE - Logan recoils, the front of his shirt \ncut open, a slash down his chest healing in front of \nMariko\xe2\x80\x99s stunned eyes. Logan pushes her back as: \nA gleaming steel blade four feet long swings for his \nhead. He ducks and rolls as the blade chops time and \nagain, gashing concrete like it were clay. The blade \nhits a dumpster and wedges in the thick steel, giving \nLogan time to take in a chilling sight. \nA FIGURE IN GLEAMING ARMOR - derived from the ancient \nJapanese noble warriors, chest emblazoned with a red \nsun. He rips the blade from the dumpster and turns. \nHis face is hidden by his gilded helmet - black \nshadows for eyes. His sword hums, raindrops sheeting \noff the crackling cushion of distorted air around it. \nLogan extends his claws and prepares to take his first \npiece out of SILVER SAMURAI. \nThe Samurai is pretty sure it will go the other way. \nIn one fluid motion he swings his charged sword, \nslicing the steel door and tearing a gash through the \nbrick wall in an arch that ends at Logan\xe2\x80\x99s neck.  \nCHING-The Samurai is surprised to see his sword \nstopped so decisively by six adamantium claws. Logan \nis just as surprised to see the Samurai\xe2\x80\x99s blade \ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t break. Instead it throws off blue arches of \nenergy between Logan\xe2\x80\x99s claws, blistering his flesh. 30.'b'Logan screams and shoves the blade back, attacking. \nBut the Samurai is fast, calm, almost prescient. \nWhere Logan slashes, the blade is there to meet him. \nThe few times he hits armor his claws encounter the \nsame barrier of energy, raking across harmlessly. \nSamurai raises his blade. This is going to hurt.\nCLOSE ON: LOGAN\xe2\x80\x99S RIGHT FIST. Two of his three claws \nretract. \nSCHUNK- Then an unholy scream of agony and rage. \nCLOSE ON: LOGAN\xe2\x80\x99S RIGHT FIST, a single claw, driven \nneatly between two plates of armor in the Samurai\xe2\x80\x99s \nside, the energized metal scalding Logan\xe2\x80\x99s hand.\nThe Samurai kicks Logan back, momentarily slowed by \nthe wound to his side. Logan lands hard, pushing \nhimself up, noticing his hands are planted on: \nA MAN-HOLE COVER\nHe considers his options, the vulnerable Mariko...\nSCHING-SLAM - Logan jams his claws into the man-hole \ncover and yanks it out, slinging the sixty-pound slab \nof steel. Samurai sees it coming, hacks it in half. \nOne piece goes wide, but the other one hits him \nsquare in the forehead, knocking him flat.  \nLogan moves Mariko to the man-hole where a ladder \nleads down into darkness. She hesitates. But when \nSamurai sits up and finds his sword, she scrambles \ndown the ladder. Logan turns as Samurai charges, \nblade high - ready to cut Logan in half. \nLogan calmly steps back and drops like a stone.\nINT. DRAIN-TUNNEL - DAY\nLogan lands in a torrent of knee-deep, rushing water. \nMariko clings to the other side of the ladder, her \nheavy gown pulling her under. Logan expertly slashes, \nsending all but Mariko\xe2\x80\x99s essentials downstream. \nSamurai looms over the man-hole above. His armor \ngives him too much bulk to come down. He hacks at \nthe man-hole, making it larger. \nLogan takes Mariko by the arm, salutes Samurai, and \nlets go of the ladder. Together they are swept away. 31.'b'EXT. ALLEY - DAY\nSamurai  continues to carve up the pavement until A \nLONE COP at the end of the alley points and yells. \nSamurai sees him and freezes. \nThe Lone Cop looks away long enough to call OTHER \nOFFICERS over. When he turns back, Samurai is gone. \nINT. DRAIN-TUNNEL - DAY\nLogan catches another ladder with one hand, holding \nMariko with the other. They climb, emerging into:\nINT. BOILER ROOM - DAY\nA giant heating system hums. Logan\xe2\x80\x99s claws pierce a \nman-hole cover and shove it aside. He climbs out, \npulls Mariko up and then collapses, exhausted. \nMariko kneels over him, his wounds miraculously \nwashed away. Their eyes meet. Mariko kisses him - \ngentle but lingering - a little more than thank you. \nLOGAN\nHave we met before? \nMARIKO\nI think I would have remembered. \nLOGAN\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t be too sure.\n(standing, sore)\n\xe2\x80\x98Should get you someplace safe. \nHe heads for the door and opens it to: \nSirens walking, POLICE EVERYWHERE. Chaos. He shuts \nthe door quickly, looking around. \nMARIKO\nI\xe2\x80\x99m safe with you. \nShe stares at him, her eyes hypnotic.\nLOGAN\nIn case you hadn\xe2\x80\x99t noticed, lady, \nI\xe2\x80\x99m barely holding my own.\n(she keeps staring)\nAnd whatever kind of trouble you\xe2\x80\x99re \nin... I\xe2\x80\x99m worse. 32.'b'MARIKO\nYou\xe2\x80\x99re the trouble I choose.\nLOGAN\nAren\xe2\x80\x99t you getting married?\nMARIKO\nEventually. \nLogan looks toward a staircase on the far side of the \nroom, leading up. He sighs. \nLOGAN\nThis way, then...\nAnd he reads her up the stairs...\nEXT. AUDITORIUM - DAY\nChaos and confusion as the police cordon off the \narea. In the rain-soaked crowd we find Zen and Yukio \nescorting Shingen to an ambulance. \nSHINGEN\n(in Japanese)\n[Where is my daughter?]\nZEN\n[We\xe2\x80\x99ll find her, Sama. First we need to \ntend to that arm.]\nThey reach the ambulance and Shingen steps in back. \nMEDICS swiftly slice off his jacket and shirt, \nrevealing a surprisingly ripped frame for his age. \nLOW ANGLE LOOKING UP as Zen goes to shut the door: \nSHINGEN\n[Find Mariko, do you hear me? \nNothing else matters.]\nZEN\n[I will search high and low, Sama.] \nHe is unaware that BEHIND HIM AND HIGH UP, Logan and \nMariko make their getaway along the rooftop.\nShingen slumps back into the ambulance. The medics go \nto work as Zen and Yukio shut the doors and stand \nguard. ACROSS THE STREET THEY SEE: \nJustice Minister Noburo talking to a MOB OF PRESS. 33.'b'NOBURO \n[... but my staff reacted swiftly \nand the would-be assassins were \npacified. I credit the fine men of \nthe Tokyo Police for putting down \nthe second wave of the attack.]\nREPORTER\n[Witnesses say Lord Shingen was the \ntarget of the attack and not you. \nDo you have any idea why someone \nwould want to kill Lord Shingen?]\nNOBURO\n[This brazen and cowardly act \nhappened just days after I proposed \na crackdown on organized crime-]\nREPORTER\n[Are you saying this is the work of \nthe Yakuza?]\nNOBURO\n(stepping away)\n[I am saying this brazen and \ncowardly act happened just days \nafter I proposed a crackdown on \norganized crime. Draw your own \nconclusions. No more questions.]\nNoburo, his Bodyguards and his knock-out Secretary \npile into two waiting limos amid a flurry of shouted \nquestions that will remain unanswered. Just before he \ngets in the car, Noburo looks ACROSS THE STREET TO: \nShingen, emerging from the ambulance, his wounds \nhidden under a new suit. The Reporters rush to get \nhis statement. As Noburo gets in his limo, Shingen \nsteals a look at Noburo\xe2\x80\x99s back, smart enough to know \nhe was being watched, smart enough not to let on. \nEXT. HOTEL - BALCONY - DAY \nLOOKING DOWN FROM A DIZZYING HEIGHT as Logan drops to \nthe top floor balcony and forces the door with a \nsingle claw. He looks up at us and extends his arms. \nANGLE ON: Mariko, seated on the edge of the rooftop. \nThe balcony is a short drop - no more than twenty \nfeet. But to miss it is a fall of several hundred. \nWithout hesitating, she drops. Logan catches her. She \nwraps her arms around his neck, holds him tightly.  34.'b'INT. LOGAN\xe2\x80\x99S PALATIAL HOTEL SUITE - BATHROOM - LATER\nThe opulence of the suite provided by Zen stands in stark \ncontrast to the wet, bedraggled occupants entering. Logan \ncarries Mariko across the threshold. \nMariko is chilled to the bone. Logan rushes into the shower, \nclothes and all, turning the water on full. He tries to put \nher down, but she clings to him, staring into his eyes. He \nmoves to speak and she puts a hand on his mouth. She doesn\xe2\x80\x99t \nwant to talk.  \nWhen he tires to talk anyway, she kisses him. Then the \ngentleman gives way to the animal...\nINT. PALATIAL HOTEL SUITE - BATHROOM - LATER\nA trail of wet clothes leads from the shower to-\nINT. PALATIAL HOTEL SUITE - BEDROOM - NIGHT/DAY\n-the bed where Mariko sleeps peacefully. \nLogan stands over her, wounded look on his face, put there by \ndeep suffering in his forgotten past. AN anguish without a \nname. DISSOLVE AS: \nThe sun rises. Logan has hardly moved. Mariko stirs, looks \naround, about to ask \xe2\x80\x9cdid we?\xe2\x80\x9d \nLOGAN\nYou were asleep before you were out \nof the shower. \nShe is at once relieved and disappointed. \nMARIKO\nHow long have you been-\nLOGAN\nAll night. \nPause. Logan stares at Mariko.\nMARIKO\nThe way you look at me. \nLOGAN\nWhat about it?35.'b"MARIKO\nI remind you of someone you used to \nknow.\nLOGAN.\nNo... Someone I used to be...\nShe studies him for a moment. \nMARIKO\nWhy are you here? In Japan. \nLOGAN\nAre you really going to marry him?\nThis catches her off guard. She recovers. Nods. \nLOGAN (CONT\xe2\x80\x99D)\nJust like that.\nMARIKO\nIt is my duty. I accept that. \nLOGAN\nBut is it what you want?\nMARIKO\nWhat I want doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter. I serve \nsomething greater. \nLOGAN\nThe House of Yashida.\nMARIKO\nYou understand.\nLOGAN\nNot really. \nMARIKO\n... You should sleep.\nLOGAN\nI gave it up.\nShe smiles, doesn't buy it. After a beat: \nMARIKO\nCome.\nShe moves over in the bed, making room for him. Logan \nhesitates, but her eyes insist. He sits on the bed, \nunsure. Mariko gently pushes him back on the pillow. 36."b'She touches his cheek, tracing a finger gently across \nhis lips, his eyebrows.\nMARIKO (CONT\xe2\x80\x99D) \nClose your eyes.\n(as he does)\nWhen I was a little girl I had \nterrible nightmares. My father \nwould say go back to sleep. Face \nyour fears. \nLOGAN\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s a few fears I\xe2\x80\x99d like him to \nmeet.  \nMARIKO\n(ignoring this)\nMy grandfather was different.\nLOGAN\nTell me about your grandfather. \nMARIKO\nYou knew him.\nLOGAN\nWe only met briefly. \nMARIKO\nAnother time. Where was I?\nLOGAN\nYour father said \xe2\x80\x98face your fears.\xe2\x80\x99\nMARIKO\nAh, yes. He did. But my grandfather\nwould tell me stories about Kuzuri.\nA fierce and terrible creature that \nwould do whatever I commanded. He \nwould protect me from my fears.  \nLOGAN\n... Kuzuri.\nMARIKO\nMmm-hmmm. Half-man, half-beast - a \nheart filled with rage... And \nsix... long claws. \nHe opens his eyes. She nods: \xe2\x80\x9cYou heard right.\xe2\x80\x9d\nLOGAN\nDid the nightmares stop?37.'b'MARIKO\nYes... But even as a little girl, I \nnever believed he was real. \nShe touches his eyes, closing them gently.\nMARIKO (CONT\xe2\x80\x99D)\nSo now... Kuzuri... Do as I say. \nClose your eyes. And let me watch \nover you. \nShe kisses him once, twice, a third time. Logan beings to \nrespond, but then: \nMARIKO (CONT\xe2\x80\x99D)\nNow sleep. \nHe closes his eyes and exhaustion takes over as: \nMARIKO (CONT\xe2\x80\x99D)\nHe needs help, Zen. \nINT. PALACIAL HOTEL SUITE LIVING ROOM - LATER\nMariko whispers into the phone. Logan sleeps fitfully \nin the next room, tortured by his nightmares. \nZEN (ON PHONE)\nThat does not mean you have to-\nMARIKO\nHe saved my life . I am in his debt. \nLong silence. Zen sighs. \nZEN (ON PHONE)\nWhat do you want me to do? \nMARKIO\nYou came here looking for me. You \ndid not find me.\n(when there is no reply)\nSay it.

His eyes open with a start. \nPULL BACK TO REVEAL: Darkness outside and a full-moon \nover Tokyo. Logan is alone, a rhythmic tapping O.S. \nINT. PALATIAL HOTEL SUITE - LIVINGROOM- NIGHT\nCandle-light, a warm fire. Logan comes out of the \nbedroom to find the table set for two, Mariko is in \nthe kitchen putting the finishing touches on dinner. \nMARIKO\nSit. \nShe brings him something more akin to art than \ndinner. \nMARIKO (CONT\xe2\x80\x99D)\nEat. \nAnd he does.\nCLOSE ON: The dinner table as the moonlight fades to \npale blue, giving way to sunrise again. The dinner \nplates are gone replaced by breakfast.  \nThe sun rises and sets two more times as Logan and \nMariko live a stolen, ordinary life. \nStanding in front of the massive bay window \noverlooking Tokyo, Mariko teaches Logan the slower, \nmore graceful forms of Aikido - a discipline for \nwhich he has no patience. Balancing on one foot he \nmanges to fall more than once, but in time, he and \nMariko move in perfect unison. Combat becomes \nmeditation and - in their case - a dance.  \nShe also teaches Logan how to cook, with an emphasis \non cutting tools. Every meal is an unconscious lesson \nin perfecting the use of edged weapons. Logan\xe2\x80\x99s claws \nare offered to help and summarily rejected. \nLogan is a disaster with chop-sticks, determined to \neat with his fingers. Mariko slaps the back of his \nhands any time he even tries. He uses his claws like \nskewers to stab his food and Mariko surrenders.  39.'b'INT. PALATIAL SUITE - BEDROOM NIGHT \nEach night she lays him down, talking softly in his \near, holding his hand or rubbing his shoulders - then \nwatching over him while he sleeps fitfully, touching \nhim reassuringly at the slightest sound of distress. \nAnd, each night, he sleeps a little easier. \nINT.

He wakes not with a start, but a mere \nflinch, happy to find Mariko watching over him.\nMARIKO\nAnother nightmare? \nLOGAN\nNo. A dream.\nHe smiles. She doesn\xe2\x80\x99t. She holds out her palm, \nrevealing the green pearl. There is fear in her eyes. \nMARIKO\nWhere did you get this?\nLOGAN\nWhat is it with that thing? \nMariko signs and sits on the edge of the bed.

SUMO ARENA - DAY \nThe rippling back of a SUMO WRESTLER, his diapered \nback-side roaring toward us, feet scrambling for \npurchase.

Logan pulls a cigar. \nLOGAN\nMind if I... you know what... I\xe2\x80\x99ll \njust breathe. \nHe puts the cigar away. \nSINATRA\nYou wanted to talk. Start talking.\nLOGAN\nLeave the Yashida family alone.\nBeat. \nSINATRA\nIs that the speech. 51.'b'LOGAN\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s the speech.

Logan looms over him in nothing but \njeans and a t-shirt , soaking wet, he came by moat. \nNoburo inhales to scream and: \nSCHLICK - A second set of claws spring forth, the \nmiddle blade gently resting on Noburo\xe2\x80\x99s tongue. \nLOGAN\nShhhh.Don\xe2\x80\x99t want to wake the babe.\nNoburo glances to his left where a TRAMPY YOUNG WOMAN \nis sleeping, snoring slightly, a hand-cuff dangling \nfrom one wrist.

A single \ndrop of liquid drips from the shaft and onto Noburo\xe2\x80\x99s \nforehead. He screams as: \nLogan rolls and comes up on his feet. A second bold catches \nhim between his neck and shoulder. It over-penetrates, \nexposing the narrow steel tip, Steaming poison drops from a \nhollow point. \nCLOSE ON: A mechanical, auto-loading compound crossbow \nswiftly prepping another shot. \nA pair of slender, GREEN GLOVED HANDS shoulder the crossbow \nto REVEAL THE FACE OF: 56.'b'NOBURO\xe2\x80\x99S SECRETARY, no longer in her business-attire, \nbut a skin-tight, backless green number, complete  \nwith a black gun-belt and boots.

Instead: \nSHINGEN\nI give you... the beast.\nLogan seems to melt back into something more human, \nclaws retracting slowly, his grip on Shingen \nloosening.

Neither of them notice: 69.'b'KENUICHIO , that angry young man from the funeral, \nstanding unnoticed by the temple wall, glowering at \nthe departing carriage. Death in his eyes. Then: \nCLOSE ON: A stack of thin paper - at least one \nthousand pages - a familiar, crisp, typewriter paper, \nyellowed with age. A pair of hands picks up the stack \nand turns it over. The top sheet reads: \nPROJECT: WOLVERINE  \nFollowed by dense military jargon. PULL BACK TO: \nINT. HUMBLE APARTMENT - NIGHT\nSmall, sparsely furnished.

Her eyes flutter open \nto the sound of clanging steel O.S. \nPULL BACK TO REVEAL: She is flat on the ground behind \na railroad car, her hands bound behind her back. \nInstinctively they reach for the blade back there, \nfinding only an empty sheath. She lays on her belly \nand contorts, her entire body curling backward until \nhe heels nearly touch the small of her back.

Yukio tries to help, but he is dead \nweight. She grabs him by his tattered leather jacket, \ndragging him along the gravel. Logan screams in pain. \nYukio looks around: empty rail-yard as far as the eye \ncan see - no sign of life, no help. It\xe2\x80\x99s a last \ncause, but she won\xe2\x80\x99t quit. She is walking backward, \nher pace slowing until she hits a wall of steel. \nShe drops Logan, turns and comes face to face with: \nSILVER SAMURAI\nBravely, Yukio grabs for a blade without thinking. \nSadly, she isn\xe2\x80\x99t fast enough. \nFWACK\nBLACK\nNo sound. A bright flash. Sparks. We are looking down \nat a vaguely human form submerged in a tank of water. \nBut this is not Logan\xe2\x80\x99s dream... What emerges this \ntime is shining metal, water sizzling off in sheets. \nSteam clears TO REVEAL: \nArmor. The tachyon-charged suit of Silver Samurai.\nLogan\xe2\x80\x99s eyes spring open. He sits up suddenly as: \nSCHINK- He readies to fight. 79.'b'YUKIO\nWait-WAIT.\nYukio rushes to him, grabbing his writs and gently urging \nhim back. Logan\xe2\x80\x99s eyes focus on: \nINT. FORGE - DAY \nPart smelter, part loft apartment, part shrine to the \nlost code of Bushido , the Samurai\xe2\x80\x99s forge is where \none imagines hell\xe2\x80\x99s blacksmith might kick back.\nEmerging from the steam, in a leather apron and no \nshirt, is Kenuichio , the Angry Young Man from the \nfuneral and wedding. His only weapon: a cup of tea.\nKENUICHIO\nDrink.\nYUKIO\nThis is Kenuichio. He\xe2\x80\x99s a friend.\nLogan spies a nice new bruise on Yukio\xe2\x80\x99s chin. \nLOGAN\nYour friend\xe2\x80\x99s give you that?\nYUKIO\nI might have tried to kill him a \nlittle. My blood was up.\nLOGAN\nWe weren\xe2\x80\x99t exactly friends at the \nfuneral, either.\nKENUICHIO\nMy apologies. I thought you were \ntrying to kidnap Mariko. Not save \nher life. \nLOGAN\nI understand. You were just looking \nout for your sister.\nBeat. As Logan takes the tea:\nKENUICHIO\nHalf-sister. But how did you know?\nLOGAN\nI knew you were related to Shingen. \nI didn\xe2\x80\x99t know how until just now. 80.'b'YUKIO\nLord Shingen... is your father?\nKENUICHIO\nNot according to Shingen... I don\xe2\x80\x99t \nmean to say he neglected me. He\xe2\x80\x99s \ngiven me money, education.\n(gestures to the Forge)\nWithout knowing it, he\xe2\x80\x99s made all \nof this possible.\n(face darkens)\nBut he will not see me. He will not \neven acknowledge that I exist.\nYUKIO\nWhere\xe2\x80\x99s your mother?\nKENUICHIO\nShe took her own life. The shame of \nhaving a bastard was...\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s as far as Kenuichio can go without cracking. \nYukio is genuinely touched by this.\nLOGAN\nDoes Mariko know she has a brother?\nKENUICHIO\nNo. But I watch over her. That is \nhow you and I met. \nLOGAN\nAnd tonight you just happened to be \nout fora stroll at the rail-yard in \nyour Sunday-go-to-meetin\xe2\x80\x99\nKENUICHIO\nYou have been marked by The Black \nClan. I first sensed they were \nwatching you at my Grandfather\xe2\x80\x99s \nfuneral. I knew if I followed you, \nI would eventually find them.\nLOGAN\nAn Assassin groupie. Very kinky.\n(re: Yukio)\nI\xe2\x80\x99m not judging. She has a thing \nfor getting run over by trains. \nKENUICHIO\n(ignoring this)\nI had hoped to find their master \nand challenge him. I wish to be \nMaster of the Black Clan.  81.'b'LOGAN\nNot a doctor? The front end of a \nCadillac , maybe? \nKENUICHIO\nWarlord, Samurai, Shogun. Prime \nMinister, Parliament, Emperor... \nThese come and go. But The Clan is \neternal. Undying. The true keepers \nof Japan\xe2\x80\x99s destiny. They believe \nthat one man and one man alone must \nrule, bound only by his will. Not \npolitics or popular opinion. And at \nhis command, they gently steer \nJapan through the ocean of time. \nYUKIO\nRemoving those who would stand in \nher way. \nLOGAN \nSo... they\xe2\x80\x99re fascists. \nKENUICHIO\nThey tend to soil, prune the tree. \nWithout sentiment or sympathy. \nLogan and Yukio share a look, Kenuichio clearly gets \nit even if they don\xe2\x80\x99t. \nLOGAN\nWow... Okay. Uh... Digest that \nlater, right now bigger fish to \nfry. Being as I\xe2\x80\x99m marked for death \nand you seem to be the guy to ask, \nwho is the Master of the Clan? \nKENUICHIO\nWas.\nLOGAN\nPardon? \nKENUICHIO\nWho was the Master? He is dead, as \nfar as I can tell. But he must not \nhave died in combat. This would \nmean The Black Clan are Ronin, now. \nLeaderless. There will be a contest \nto choose a new master from \nchampions selected by The Clan.\nLOGAN\nAnd how do you know this?82.'b'KENUICHIO\nBecause you... have been chosen.\nKenuichio holds up the white pearl left on Logan\xe2\x80\x99s \nbody after his encounter with The Black Clan. \nKENUICHIO (CONT\xe2\x80\x99D)\nFor as long as I can remember, I \nhave dreamed of receiving such an \nhonor. It is the mark of a true \nwarrior. And now it is yours. \nLogan takes the simple pearl, suddenly imbued \nwith intense symbolic power. After a beat: \nLOGAN\nSo... what happens next? \nKENUICHIO\nYou will kill or be killed.\n(off Logan\xe2\x80\x99s look)\nYou have no choice in the matter. \nYour opponent will hunt you to the \nends of the Earth to win the prize.\nLOGAN\nWhat if neither of us want to be \nMaster? \nKENUICHIO\nYou\xe2\x80\x99re saying you don\xe2\x80\x99t? \nLOGAN\nWell... I\xe2\x80\x99ve got my thing. It\xe2\x80\x99s a \nbig change, you know?\nKENUICHIO\nYou hold immense power in your \nhand, Logan-san. A nation\xe2\x80\x99s \ndestiny. The fate of millions. It \nis not to be taken lightly. \nLOGAN\nYeah. No. Clearly not. Just out of \ncuriosity, where does this leave \nus? You and me. \nKENUICHIO\nI will wait for the match to be \ndecided. Then I will challenge the \nnew Master. You understand this is \nin no way personal. I have great \naffection for you. 83.'b'LOGAN\n... Affection.\nKENUICHIO\nYou saved the lives of my family. \nYukio can\xe2\x80\x99t help but make a sound of sympathy in her \nthroat. Logan shoots her a look: \xe2\x80\x9cAre you nuts?\xe2\x80\x9d \nLOGAN\nSo... we\xe2\x80\x99re gonna go. Thanks for \nletting us freshen up and... \nI\xe2\x80\x99ll see you on the field of \nbattle, I guess. \nKENUICHIO\nI look forward to it. \nLOGAN\nI\xe2\x80\x99m sure you do.\n(toYukio)\nReady? Good. Let\xe2\x80\x99s go.\nEXT. STREET - NIGHT\nA remote section of industrial Tokyo\xe2\x80\x99s warehouse \ndistrict. Desolate at night. Logan and Yukio step out \nas a massive steel door closes slowly behind them. \nLOGAN\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll say this... Lord Shingen has \none messed-up family.\nYUKIO\nThis matters to you?\nLOGAN\nIt matters to Mariko. Her father\xe2\x80\x99s \ndisgraced the family. And she\xe2\x80\x99s \ncaught in the middle of it with no \none to help her.\nYUKIO\nYou have problems of your own right \nnow. You\xe2\x80\x99re wanted by the police, \nnot to mention the Black Clan-\nLOGAN\nThat can wait. Right now I need to \nhelp Mariko. She needs to see that \nher father is her own worst enemy. 84.'b'YUKIO\nHow can you prove that? \nLOGAN\nSomewhere in that third bottle of \nhooch my mind went back to the \nfuneral - the men who tired to kill \nShingen. Someone wanted him dead. \nSomeone had a reason. My gut says \nthat reason is the key to \neverything. If I could just find \nout who gave the order...\nBut it\xe2\x80\x99s hopeless. Until: \nYUKIO\nWhen I\xe2\x80\x99m lost... I go back to where \nthings began. \nLogan considers this and nods. \nLOGAN\nYou\xe2\x80\x99re right... You\xe2\x80\x99re absolutely \nright, Yukio.\n(starts walking)\nThanks. I\xe2\x80\x99ll see you around.\nYUKIO\n(going after him)\nWhere are you going?\nLOGAN\nTo see a sick friend.\nYUKIO\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll go with you.\nLOGAN\nNot this again, please.\nShe grabs his arm, stopping him.\nYUKIO\nI can help you.\nLOGAN\nSome people are gonna get hurt.\nYUKIO\nThen I can really help you.\nLOGAN\nWhat\xe2\x80\x99s Shingen giving you for \nfollowing me?85.'b'Her smile fades. She tries to play dumb until: \nLOGAN (CONT\xe2\x80\x99D)\nMy bodyguard, Yukio? Come on. \nAwkward pause. Then Yukio caves.\nYUKIO\nI\xe2\x80\x99m an orphan. Not even a half-\nblooded Japanese. Shingen promised \nto be my master. A servant of the \nHouse Yashida. Can you understand \nwhat that means? \nLOGAN\nIt means you\xe2\x80\x99re a servant with \nbetter clothes.\nYUKIO\nHe said you\xe2\x80\x99re a mindless killer - \nthat you threatened his daughter. I \ncan see now that he was lying. I \ncan tell you\xe2\x80\x99re an honorable man. \nLogan scoffs. She drops to one knee. \nYUKIO (CONT\xe2\x80\x99D)\nI wish to serve you, Logan-san.\nLOGAN\nYou wish to serve the next Master \nof the Black Clan, you mean.\nYukio can\xe2\x80\x99t hide her wry grin. \nYUKIO\nThis had also crossed my mind.\nLOGAN\nThere won\xe2\x80\x99t be a death-match, \nYukio. I\xe2\x80\x99m not gonna be the Master \nof the Black Clan. \nYUKIO\nBut you heard Kenuichio. You have \nno choice. \nLOGAN\nI neverhave a choice, That doesn\xe2\x80\x99t \nmean I have to play along. \nHe turns and walks away. Again she follows. 86.'b'YUKIO\nPlease. Logan-san. Take me with \nyou.\nLOGAN\nLeave me alone. \nYUKIO\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll show you I am worth-\nHe turns, showing enough rage to stop her cold. \nLOGAN\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t you get it. I want to be \nalone. I don\xe2\x80\x99t need you, I don\xe2\x80\x99t \nwant you and certainly don\xe2\x80\x99t trust\nyou. NOW GET LOST.\nYukio recoils but stands her ground, her eyes filing \nwith tears. He raises a hand and now she backs away. \nLOGAN (CONT\xe2\x80\x99D)\nGO. \nYUKIO\nI should have let them kill you. \nYukio turns and runs. Only then do Logan\xe2\x80\x99s eyes \nbetray his true feelings. He turns and heads the \nother way, disgusted with himself.  \nINT. FORGE - NIGHT\nKenuichio at the window, watching Yukio and Logan \npart ways. \nVOICE (O.S.)\nYou should have killed him.\nKENUICHIO\nAfter the new Master is chosen.\nAnd from out of the darkness, Viper emerges to stand at his \nside, taking his hand.\nVIPER\nDo you think you can kill him?\nKENUICHIO\nWith your help? It\xe2\x80\x99s certain. But \nfirst we deal with Mariko. 87.'b'KENUICHIO (CONT\xe2\x80\x99D)\nWhen she is dead, I will be \nShingen\xe2\x80\x99s only child. He will have \nno choice but to recognize me as \nhis sole heir. \nHe looks around at the Forge with disgust. \nKENUICHIO (CONT\xe2\x80\x99D)\nThen, finally, I can emerge from \nthe shadows and be called by my \ntrue name\nVIPER\nKenuichio Yashida.\nKENUICHIO\n(taking her in his arms)\nAnd when the House Yashida and The \nBlack Clan are gone... No one... No \none... will ever ignore me again. \nThey kiss. And as they do we MOVE IN CLOSE ON: \nA NEEDLE in Viper\xe2\x80\x99s hand. It pierces the back of his \nneck and he shivers. Whatever this concoction is, it \nworks for him. He smiles, looking deep into her eyes. \nVIPER\nNever forget who you love. Never \nforget who you serve.\nKENUICHIO\nNever... Never.\nAnd they kiss again. \nEXT. TOKYO METROPOLITAN HOSPITAL - NIGHT \nEst. \nINT. TOKYO METROPOLITAN HOSPITAL - CORRIDOR - NIGHT\nMOVE SLOWLY down a corridor toward TWO POLICE \nOFFICERS standing guard outside a private room. \nQuiet at this hour, save the sound of heart monitors, \nthe faint chatter of nurses, the odd page on the PA. \nWe linger long enough to get used to it. Then: \nA faint sound stirs the Cops from their thousand-yard \nstare. They share a look, wait. They hear it again. 88.'b'Ka-chunk Ka-chunk - Very far away. \nThey open the door they are guarding and look into: \nINT.

Thanks \nto his distinctly ruddy complexion, we recognize: \nTHE PIT-FACED THUG who cut Shingen at the funeral.\nThe Cops share another look, shrug, close the door. \nThen we hear the sound again: \nKa-chunk Ka-chunk Ka-chunk.\nEXT. TOKYO METROPOLITAN - TEN STORIES UP - NIGHT\nTHE SOURCE OF THE SOUND is Logan, legs dangling, \nsweating buckets, arms strained to the breaking \npoint. All six claws are sunken into the brick facade \nof the hospital. After a brief rest, he tears the \nleft claws out and drives them back in again - slowly \nscaling down the otherwise smooth wall- \nKA-CHUNK KA-CHUNK KA-CHUNK - until he finds himself \ndangling by the window he\xe2\x80\x99s looking for. He hangs \nfrom one hand and uses the other to slice the latch.  \nINT.

A hand comes into frame and gently \nremoves the oxygen mask from his face. \nPit-Face gasps. His eyes open to find Logan looming.\nLOGAN\nRemember me? \nPit-Face tires to speak, to call out. His hand \nreaches for the remote call button, but Logan takes \nit away without effort. \nLOGAN (CONT\xe2\x80\x99D)\nEasy.

He pushes it open and finds: \nINT. HUMBLE APARTMENT - NIGHT\nZen lyingon the floor - swollen purple track marks on his \nforearm. Logan rushes to him and kneels. \nLOGAN\nZen. Ah, geeze ... Zen. Who did this \nto you>?\nZen\xe2\x80\x99s eyes are slits, his voice a trembling whisper. 90.'b'ZEN\nShingen.\nLogan notices a hole in the floorboards. Empty.

As you said, Lord Shingen. \nShingen snaps out of his thoughts, locking eyes on \nYukio now. Does he know she\xe2\x80\x99s lying? Tense pause. \nSHINGEN\nYou may call me Master.\nYukio is stunned. Deep emotions well up inside her. \nYUKIO\n... Master? \nHe puts a hand on her shoulder. She flinches, then \nlooks at his hand, aching for a father. But this one? \nSHINGEN\nThis information is of great value. \nYou have done well, Yukio. You are \nnow a servant of the House Yashida.\nStunned, conflicted, Yukio bows.\nYUKIO\nDomoarigato, Sama.\nShingen waves her away. She backs out of the room, \nwiping tears from her eyes. When she is gone, Shingen \nturns to face the window, his reflection a specter \nover the whole of the port city below. \nSHINGEN\nHim... They chose him. How could he \nbe worthy and not I? How could-\nSCHINK-Three blades appear across his throat - the \ntop one pressing tightly against his jugular. Shingen \ndoes not dare to move. But he shows no fear.  \nHE studies the blades in his reflection as they \nslowly, silently retract. To our confusion, the top \nand bottom blades retract left-to-right. The middle \nblade retracts right to left. Shingen turns to face: \nTHE MONK and TWO MEN OF THE BLACK CLAN, each holding \none knife - the blades he thought were Logan\xe2\x80\x99s \nSHINGEN (CONT\xe2\x80\x99D)\nI... have been expecting you.  94.'b'The Monk throws a punch, his fist stopping just a \nhair from Shingen\xe2\x80\x99s nose.

Stunning women decorate \nthe men who can afford/don\xe2\x80\x99t deserve them. Big money \nchanges hand, most of it Euro and Yuan. The Oyabun \nhimself plays dominoes with a few minions. \nAT THE BAR \xe2\x80\x9cSinatra,\xe2\x80\x9d (or at least Japan\xe2\x80\x99s answer \nthere-to) keeps one eye on the scene while fending \noff numerous carnal opportunities. Then she walks in: \nShe wears a red dress cut dangerously low, a slit up \none side riding scandalously high. Men step aside at \nher approach as if she might set them on fire. One \nhas to admit, Yukio cleans up nice.  \nSinatra sees her coming and quickly shoos a BRAZILIAN \nBOMBSHELL off her stool. 97.'b"Yukio eases into the opening and offers a mind-\nmelting smile before whispering in his ear. Sinatra\xe2\x80\x99s \nsmile fades to disappointment. He stands, looks Yukio \nup and down, and motions for her to wait. \nINT. BACK OFFICE - NIGHT\nSinatra enters to find Logan, shuffling cards, bored. \nA caged animal. Sinatra jerks his head.\nSINATRA\nYou know this biscuit? \nThrough the one-way glass making up the aquarium\xe2\x80\x99s \nmirrors back, Logan sees Yukio at the bar. He sighs. \nLOGAN\nAh hell.\nSINATRA\nYou want I should take care of her? \nLOGAN\nYou don\xe2\x80\x99t mean kill her. \nSINATRA\nI mean marryher. She's got legs up \nto her neck.\nLOGAN\nShe say what she wants\nSINATRA\nHas information for you. Wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t \nsay what. Says you\xe2\x80\x99d know what it \nis about just by looking at her. \nThrough gently drifting tentacles, Yukio sips a \ncocktail. A ring conspicuously parked on her finger \nfeatures a large white pearl. \nSINATRA (CONT\xe2\x80\x99D)\nSo are you two... uh- \nLOGAN\nNo. \nSINATRA\n(smiles/straightens tie)\nGot her number? \nLOGAN\nI\xe2\x80\x99m not sure I do. 98."b'INT. BACK OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER\nSinatra shuts the door behind him, leaving Yukio and Logan \nalone. She sits opposite from him and crosses her legs, \nletting the slit in her dress say hello.\nLOGAN\nHow did you find me? \nYUKIO\nWho lese could hide you on a tiny \nisland full of short people? \nLOGAN\nWhat do you want?\nYUKIO\nThe police aren\xe2\x80\x99t the only ones \nlooking for you. Shingen\xe2\x80\x99s been \nchosen by The Black Clan. He knows \nyou have been, too.\nLOGAN\nHow\xe2\x80\x99dhe find that out?\nYUKIO\nSlip of the tongue.\nLOGAN\nIf I kill him, you won\xe2\x80\x99t have a \nmaster.\nYUKIO\nWho says I want him dead? \nLogan shakes his head and smiles. She smiles back.\nYUKIO (CONT\xe2\x80\x99D)\nWhat will you do?\nLOGAN\nMaybe I\xe2\x80\x99ll turn myself in. I can do \nthirty years standing on my head. \nSpend it watching Shingen trying to \nbreak into jail so he can kill me.\nYUKIO\nHardly practical.\nLOGAN\nBut funny.\nShe drops the cool act and leans in. 99.'b'YUKIO\nEveryone has someone they\xe2\x80\x99d like to \nknow was dead. They may not want to \ndo the deed, but they\xe2\x80\x99d like to \nknow the deed was done. Someone \nwho\xe2\x80\x99s escaped justice. Someone \nwilling to harm the innocent. \nSomeone who cares more about power \nthan they do about human life.\n(offhis blank look)\nCome on, Logan... Master of The \nBlack Clan. The finger of God. The \npower to take life with no fear of \nconsequence. Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t that tempt you \nin the least? \nStill Logan says nothing. She stands, waving a \ndismissive hand and turning for the door.\nYUKIO (CONT\xe2\x80\x99D)\nWhy do I bother? Shingen is my \nmaster now. I win if you lose. I \nhave nothing to gain by convincing \nyou to fight. \nThen she lunges, kissing him deeply. He might even \nkiss back. In ends with a bite. A little anger. Then: \nYUKIO (CONT\xe2\x80\x99D)\nFor God\xe2\x80\x99s sake, fight.\nLOGAN\nCan\xe2\x80\x99t do it Yukio.\nYUKIO\nWhy?\n(whenhe doesn\xe2\x80\x99t answer)\nNever mind. I know why. \nShe turns and opens the door TO REVEAL: \nMARIKO in a raincoat, hiding behind big sunglasses.\nLogan stands, stunned to see her. Yukio holds a hand \nout. Mariko gives her a large bundle of cash. Then, \nscoffing, Yukio walks out. \nAlone now, Logan and Mariko stare at one another for \na moment, each unsure what to say. Finally, Mariko \ntakes off the shades TO REVEAL A RAISED BRUISE on her \ncheek. Make-up hides A SMALL CUT ON HER LIP. \nLOGAN\nNoburo?100.'b'She nods ever so slightly, her lip trembling. \nCLOSE ON: Logan. A flash of rage, a tide of fury. \nThen he takes her arm in his arms, closes his eyes, \nexhales to the bottom of his soul, whispering: \nLOGAN (CONT\xe2\x80\x99D)\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s all right. I\xe2\x80\x99m here.\nMARIKO\nI\xe2\x80\x99m so sorry.\nLOGAN\nYou\xe2\x80\x99re sorry? What for? \nMARIKO\nYou only wanted to protect me. And \nI rejected you.\nLOGAN\nI knew you\xe2\x80\x99d come around.\nThis almost makes her smile.\nMARIKO\nI went to see Zen at the hospital. \nYou may have saved his life.\nLOGAN\nHe may have saved mine. \nMARIKO\nYukio told me what she could. Zen \nsaid you would tell me the rest.\nLOGAN\nYou know about The Black Clan. That \nyour father and I have been chosen.\n(off her nod)\nDid you know your Grandfather was \nthe last Master of the Black Clan? \nMariko is shocked.\nLOGAN (CONT\xe2\x80\x99D)\nHe used The Black Clan to make sure \nJapan would never see another war. \nBut someone discovered his secret \nand challenged him... That someone \nwas your father.\nMariko\xe2\x80\x99s hand goes to her lips. 101.'b'LOGAN (CONT\xe2\x80\x99D)\nYour Grandfather was faced with an \nunthinkable dilemma. To win, he\xe2\x80\x99d \nhave to kill his only son. If he \nlost, The Black Clan would belong \nto Shingen; a man willing to kill \nhis own father for power. \nMARIKO\nAre you saying... my father... \nkilled my grandfather?\nLOGAN\nYour grandfather was smarter than \nthat. No... he took his own life. \nHe deliberately left The Black Clan \nwithout a Master.\nAnd now tears fill her eyes.\nLOGAN (CONT\xe2\x80\x99D)\nThe last thing he did was mark me \nfor death. A man he\xe2\x80\x99d met only \nonce. But a man he\xe2\x80\x99d been watching \nfor seventy years. A man he knew \nbetter than his own son. He knew \nwhen The Black Clan faced me  \nKuzuri- they would choose me as a \nchampion.\nMARIKO\nBut my grandfather was a good man-\nLOGAN\nHe was a great man. Cursed with a \nterrible responsibility. Confronted \nwith a terrible choice. He did the \nbest any man could do. And now he \nexpects me to avenge his death... \nTo restore his family\xe2\x80\x99s honor. But \nto do that, I\xe2\x80\x99d have to kill his \nonly son... I\xe2\x80\x99d have to kill your \nfather. \nMariko considers this dilemma until she accepts the \ninevitable, prove her mettle: \nMARIKO\nThen you must honor his wish.\nLogan is at once impressed and saddened.\nLOGAN\nNo. 102.'b'MARIKO\nYou mustn\xe2\x80\x99t think of my feelings. \nThink of Japan. My family. \nLOGAN\nMariko, as long as I don\xe2\x80\x99t face \nyour father. The Black Clan will \nhave no master. Japan will be free \nto choose her own destiny - for \nbetter or worse. \nMARIKO\nMY father will hunt you for as long \nas he lives. \nLOGAN\nThen the joke\xe2\x80\x99s on him. \nBut she is not amused. \nLOGAN (CONT\xe2\x80\x99D)\nHey, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been on the move for as \nlong as I can remember. At least \nnow it\xe2\x80\x99ll mean something.\nMARIKO\nThen take me with you.\nLogan wasn\xe2\x80\x99t expecting that part. His heart swells, \nbut he stuffs it back down.  \nLOGAN\nYou don\xe2\x80\x99t know what you\xe2\x80\x99re asking.\nMARIKO\n(pointing to her bruised face) \nLook at me. I know exactly what I\xe2\x80\x99m \nasking. \nShe kisses him. Logan gives in, taking her in his \narms. She buries her head in his chest. \nMARIKO (CONT\xe2\x80\x99D)\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t even know you. And yet...\nLOGAN\nYou know I\xe2\x80\x99ll always protect you. \nMARIKO\nI do... I do...\nThe door opens. Sinatra stops halfway through when he \nsees what\xe2\x80\x99s going on. Just past him we see Yukio. She \nsees Mariko in Logan\xe2\x80\x99s arms and quickly turns away. 103.'b'LOGAN\nWe\xe2\x80\x99re adding a passenger.\nSINATRA\nWe have plenty of room.\nThe low bellow of a ships horn takes us to: \nEXT. TOKYO WATERFRONT - NIGHT\nWhere a massive cargo freighter is casting off its \nmoorings and getting ready to make way. \nThree Mercedes sedans race to the edge of the pier. \nLogan, Mariko, and TWO YAKUZAGOONS get out of one. \nSinatra, Yukio and SIX GOONS get out of the others. \nLogan hears a thumping noise coming from the back of \nYukio\xe2\x80\x99s car. She tries to look innocent. Logan pops \nthe trunk TO REVEAL: \nNoburo, bound and gagged, putting up quite a squawk. \nLogan glares at Yukio. She shrugs.\nYUKIO\nWhen I went to get Mariko he put up \na fuss, so...\nLOGAN\nPut him back.\nYUKIO\nFirst thing tomorrow-\nLOGAN\nTonight.\nLogan slams the lid. He shakes hands with Sinatra. \nYukio looks jealously down her nose at Mariko. \nMariko, behind Logan, smiles back.\nSINATRA\nIf you\xe2\x80\x99re ever back this way.\nLOGAN\nNot ever.\nSINATRA\nThen sayanora , Logan-sa-\nA deafening explosion of glass cuts him off. 104.'b'ANGLE ON: SILVER SAMURAI leaping off the crushed roof of a \nMercedes , drawing his sword in mid-air as: \nSINATRA\xe2\x80\x99S EIGHT GOONS all draw weapons and fire.\nLOGAN\nDont-\nHe grabs Mariko and covers her as a hail of bullets ricochet \noff of Samurai\xe2\x80\x99s charged armor and kill six of the goons \nbefore he lands. Once on the ground, a single sweep with his \nsword takes out the other two.\nLOGAN (CONT\xe2\x80\x99D)\nTAKE HER. \nSinatra grabs Mariko as: \nSCHINK- Logan attacks. Not to be out-done, Yukio \nkicks off her heels and, with a single yank, rips off \nthe business end of her evening gown, exposing a \nharness high up on each thigh filled with scalpels. \nSinatra gets Mariko into a car before turning and \npulling a pistol, aiming at Samurai\xe2\x80\x99s back.\nWHAM- Samurai mule kicks him without even looking. \nSinatra is out in the same instant.\nLogan and Samurai charge at one another, colliding in \nmid-air. Logan has learned a lot since their last \nencounter and he knows not to let his claws linger \ntoo long. We notice that his hands, despite his claws \nbeing extended, are open and flat - not fists. His \nmovements are more elegant, less brutish. With his \ntime in Japan, Logan the warrior has evolved. \nYukio keeps Samurai distracted. She can\xe2\x80\x99t do much \nwith strikes, but she\xe2\x80\x99s good with those scalpels and \nmanages to get them between the plates of his armor. \nNot deep enough to kill, but certainly painful. \nLOGAN (CONT\xe2\x80\x99D)\nTAKE MARIKO AND GET OUT OF HERE.\nYUKIO\nI STAY WITH YOU.\nLOGAN\nYOU\xe2\x80\x99RE GONNA GET YOURSELF KILLED.\nYUKIO\nGLORIOUSLY -105.'b'WHAM- Samurai cracks her across the face and sends \nher flying, raising his sword to finish her off. \nLogan leaps onto Samurai\xe2\x80\x99s back - the armor throwing \noff bolts of energy and burning his flesh. Logan \ntakes the pain, grabbing the brow of the Samurai\xe2\x80\x99s \nhelmet from behind,and locking his feet into the \nsmall of Samurai\xe2\x80\x99s back. Logan pushes with his feet \nand pulls with his hands, causing Samurai to bend \nback impossibly. Samurai screams in agony, flailing \nhis sword behind him, trying to stab Logan. \nLOGAN\nGO. NOW. \nYukio gets to her feet, runs for the Mercedes \ncontaining Mariko as: \nSamurai presses a recess in the Red Sun on his chest.\nFOOM-A supercharged shock-wave blows Logan off his back. \nLogan skids across the pavement, convulsing. Samurai drops to \nhis hands and knees, gasping for air. He ears the Mercedes \nengine starting and turns. \nINT. MERCEDES - NIGHT\nYukio just gets the car in gear when: \nMARIKO\nLOOK OUT.\nSamurai\xe2\x80\x99s blade hacks horizontally through the \nwindshield. Yukio ducks as the sword cuts off the \nheadrest of her car-seat. She sits up again and\nWHAM- A metal fist comes through the window and \nknocks her out cold. The car is in gear. It rolls. \nSamurai rips off the back door and drags Mariko from \nthe car, coming face-to face with his sister for the \nfirst time. She looks at his eyes through his visor, \nunafraid. His eyes soften with admiration. Then he \nremembers himself and drags her past: \nLogan, Just now recovering, struggling to find his \nfeet. Samurai swings. Logan blocks and: \nSCHUNK- Logan howls in pain. \nCLOSE ON: Samurai\xe2\x80\x99s blade between Logan\xe2\x80\x99s claws and \ndeep into the center of his hand. Meanwhile: 106.'b'INT. MERCEDES - NIGHT\nYukio come to, dazed. Unaware the car is moving, she \nopens the door and steps out, landing hard. The \nMercedes rolls off the pier and into the water. \nThe trunk opens on impact, REVEALING NOBURO - eyes \nwide with terror - just before the trunk inhales \nwater and the car sinks like a stone. \nANGLE ON: Samurai, as he kicks Logan onto his back.\nSAMURAI\nAccept your destiny, gai-jin. Go to \nthe Stronghold. Face Shingen. If \nnot, she dies. \nWHACK - Samurai kicks Logan under the chin, snapping \nhis head back and knocking him out cold. Mariko is \ndragged away, looking back at Logan as things go: \nBLACK \nINT. YASHIDA STRONGHOLD - SHINGEN\xe2\x80\x99S OFFICE - NIGHT\nWHITE GLOVED SERVANTS take down the Yashida Family \nswords, carrying the precious relics reverently. \nINT. YASHIDA STRONGHOLD - NIGHT\nViper scrapes the small traces of Logan\xe2\x80\x99s dried blood \nfrom the crossbow bolt into a porcelain bowl, mixing \nit with a minute amounts of other compounds in a thin \nglass tube, distilling it over an open flame. The \nresult: \nA SINGLE DROP OF BLOOD RED LIQUID. The care with \nwhich she handles it tells us it is highly lethal.\nLATER: Viper melts pale green wax over a candle until \nit is the consistency of water. She adds the single \ndrop of red liquid to the green wax, mixing it in. \nLATER: she dips A DAGGER, its blade ornately \nengraved, into the molten wax. As it cools, the wax \nin the blade\xe2\x80\x99s engraving appears pale green - more \nlike patina than lethal poison. 107.'b'INT. YASHIDA STRONGHOLD - TEMPLE - NIGHT\nShingen prays on his hands and knees, incense \nburning, sensing a presence. Opening his eyes. \nViper offers the green-bladed dagger.\nVIPER\nOne cut... And you\xe2\x80\x99ll kill him.\nShingen shakes his head, no. Viper grins, shrugs. \nVIPER (CONT\xe2\x80\x99D)\nIf all else fails. \nHe reaches for the blade but stops himself, unsure.\nSHINGEN\nVictory without honor\nVIPER\nBut certain victory. \nNow she\xe2\x80\x99s got him. Shingen considers this temptress, \nhis hands hovering over her knife, interrupted by: \nVOICE (O.S.)\nSHINGEN!\nINT. YASHIDA STRONGHOLD - GREAT HALL - NIGHT\nSamurai, still in his armor, helmet under one arm, \ncasts a long shadow across the floor of the grand \nentrance. He holds Mariko by the wrist. \nSAMURAI\nSHIIIIINGENNNNN.\nSHINGEN (O.S.)\nWhat is the meaning of-\nShingen emerges on the second floor balcony. When he \nsees Samurai\xe2\x80\x99s face: \nSHINGEN (CONT\xe2\x80\x99D)\nYou.\nSAMURAI\nI have come home, father.\nMARIKO\nFather? 108.'b'Mariko blinks. She can tell by her father\xe2\x80\x99s face that \nSamurai is not speaking metaphorically. Shingen \ndescends to greet his bastard face-to-face. \nSHINGEN\nHow dare you show your face here. \nHow dare you lay a hand on m-\nSHING- Samurai drops his helmet and draws his sword - \nthe tip cracking just under Shingen\xe2\x80\x99s chin. \nSAMURAI\n-mysister. \nSHINGEN\nWhat do you want?\nSAMURAI\nThe animal is coming to claim her. \nYou will face him Whoever is left \nwill face me and then I... Will be \nMaster of The Black Clan. \nShingen considers, clearly plotting. Then: \nSHINGEN\nVery well. I accept. Let her go.\nSAMURAI\nYou are not the Master yet. \nSHINGEN\nIgnorant boy... I am Lord Shingen \nof the House Yashida, standing in \nthe great hall of my ancestors and \nI am telling you now... I will\nwin... In fact, I cannot lose. \nThe sound of a weapon cocking O.S. Samurai hauls \nMariko in front of him, his blade to her throat as a \nfigure appears at the top of the stairs.  \nViper aims a crossbow right at him. Samurai\xe2\x80\x99s eyes widen, his \nsoul drops.\nSAMURAI\nNo...\nSHINGEN\nYou see? I gave you more than you \never knew...109.'b'Viper smiles, shrugs, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat can I say, kid?\xe2\x80\x9d Samurai \nlets Mariko go, heartbroken. Shingen waves to Viper. \nShe lowers her weapon. \nSHINGEN (CONT\xe2\x80\x99D)\nThe boy has too much potential.\n(to Samurai)\nIt would be a shame to waste it. \nEXT. YASHIDA STRONGHOLD - FRONT GATE - NIGHT\nLogan and Yukio arrive in her car. Guards merely \nglance at them before letting them pass. \nEXT. YASHIDA STRONGHOLD - TREELINE - NIGHT\nA treeline at the edge of the property. Nothing \nremarkable. Until A PAIR OF EYES OPENS. \nThe Monk is standing right in front of us. He is \nwatching the car head toward the stronghold.\nINT. YASHIDA STRONGHOLD - GREAT HALL - NIGHT\nThe house is still. Dark. Eerie. Logan enters, \ninhaling deeply through his nose. \nLOGAN\nThis way...\nEXT. JAPANESE GARDEN - NIGHT\nA full moon casts cold blue light over a magnificent \ngarden complete with ponds, bridges, pagodas - like a \npainted backdrop fora grand staging of the Mikado. \nGround lights come on, one by one, illuminating a \nlight mist in the trees, simultaneously making the \nlandscape more visible and creepy. The last light \nilluminates the open center of the garden and: \nMARIKO, more worried for Logan than herself. Logan \ntakes half a step. Yukio grabs his arm, stopping him. \nYUKIO\nJust... wait. \nShingen and Viper step out from the shadows on one \nside of her. Silver Samurai steps out from the other. 110.'b'ANGLE ON: The Monk, draped in shadow, looking down \nfrom atop the high garden wall. Watching. Waiting. \nSHINGEN\nAre you ready to face your destiny?\nLOGAN\nSure, why not?\nSHINGEN\nThen come forward.\nLOGAN \nMariko leaves with Yukio first. \nSAMURAI\nShe leaves when I am satisfied.\nLogan sighs, whispers to Yukio.\nLOGAN\nIs everybody here such a blowhard? \nShe shrugs: \xe2\x80\x9cpretty much.\xe2\x80\x9d Logan approaches his \nopponents as they form a wall in front of Mariko. \nShingen wears a robe bearing the Yashida symbol - the \nfamily\xe2\x80\x99s two swords in the sash around his waist. \nEXTREME CLOSE-UP AS: He reaches inside his robe, \nadjusting the POISON DAGGER PREPARED BY VIPER. He \ntook the dishonorable option after all.\nLogan stops a few yards from Shingen. Yukio just \nbehind him. Logan and Viper make eye contact - the \nfirst time since their lethal encounter at Noburo\xe2\x80\x99s. \nLOGAN (CONT\xe2\x80\x99D)\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t youget around? \nShe shrugs, smiles. Samurai bristles at the remark.\nSHINGEN\n(to Yukio)\nYou may go.\nYUKIO\nI stay with Logan.\nSHINGEN\nThen you\xe2\x80\x99ll die with him. 111.'b'YUKIO\nBetter I die serving him than live \nserving you.\nLOGAN\nNow, now, we\xe2\x80\x99re all friends here.\nSAMURAI\nKill this dog, Shingen.\nLOGAN\n(re: Samurai)\nLook at this vulture, waiting to \nfeast on the leftovers.\n(to Shingen)\nWhat say we team this punk? Then \nyou and me can settle up as the \nmain event. \nSAMURAI\n(drawing his sword)\nIMPUDENT -\nSHINGEN\nENOUGH. \nSamurai freezes humiliated Yukio laughs Viper \nshakes her head embarrassed for Samurai. \nSHINGEN (CONT\xe2\x80\x99D)\n(to Logan)\nI expected you to bring dishonor to \nthis affair. \n(to Samurai)\nBut you? Where is your dignity? \n(backto Logan)\nYou think you can turn y our \nopponents against one another and \nsteal a victory. As a man with no \ninterest in the prize at stake, \nthat is your advantage. \nLogan smiles at Samurai.\nLOGAN\nHe\xe2\x80\x99s smarter than you.\nSHINGEN\nPick up your weapon. \nThat\xe2\x80\x99s when Logan sees an object on the ground a few \nfeet in front of Shingen: Old Man Yashida\xe2\x80\x99s sword. 112.'b'SHINGEN (CONT\xe2\x80\x99D)\nAn appropriate choice, I thought.\nLOGAN\nI won\xe2\x80\x99t be needing it, thanks. \nSCHINK\nSHINGEN\nI had hoped we could fight man-to-\nman. Not man-to... mechanism. \nLogan considers this.\nYUKIO\n(quietly, to herself)\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t doooiiiit.\nLOGAN\nY\xe2\x80\x99arright.\nSCNICK- his claws retract. \nLOGAN (CONT\xe2\x80\x99D)\nMan-to-man. \nMARIKO\nNo...\nSHINGEN\nI have your word of honor, then.\nLOGAN\nFor what it\xe2\x80\x99s worth.\nLogan hooks a toe under the scabbard and kicks the \nsword up into his hands. He draws the blade and \ninspects the weapon he first saw seventy years ago. \nShingen slowly draws the ancient blade of his family, \nplacing the flat side reverently to his head. After a \nshort prayer, he holds the sword in both hands, \ngetting into position with a flourish. \nLogan just stands there. Sword at his side. Pause. \nSHINGEN\n... Begin. \nShingen attacks. Mariko gasps. In a flash, Logan \nbrings his sword up one-handed, blocking a strike \naimed right for his neck.113.'b'Shingen steps back, waits... Strikes again. Again \nLogan blocks him, then lets the sword hang. \nShingen adjusts, moving in combinations of  blows \nrather than single, precise strikes. Again, Logan \nmanages to block. The energy of the fight leaves one \nwith the impression of a train leaving the station, \ngaining in speed and intensity, steel on steel, \nhitting faster and faster. Logan grips the sword with \nboth hands now, his form matching Shingen\xe2\x80\x99s until \nblades collide five times a second and still...\nShingen cannot hit Logan. \nShingen stops, steps back, a little winded, the \nblades ringing in a long, sustained chord. \nViper is in awe. Samurai is impatient. Mariko \ntrembles. And Yukio smiles. \nShingen screams and attacks with renewed ferocity. \nLogan\xe2\x80\x99s blade responds ass if magnetized, meeting \nShingen\xe2\x80\x99s no matter what direction it comes from.\nANGLE ON: The Monk, expressionless, emotionless, \nwatching from high atop the garden wall. Keener eyes \nwill notice two more Men of the Clan are with him. \nShingen stops again, frustrated. \nYUKIO\nYou can\xe2\x80\x99t hit him.\nLOGAN\nI told you. I was built to learn. \nAnd you\xe2\x80\x99re one hell of a Sensei.\nSAMURAI\n(to Logan)\nFinish him then. \nLOGAN\nNo. \nSAMURAI\nKill or be killed. That is the \ncontest.\nLOGAN\nStuff your contest. I won\xe2\x80\x99t kill \nhim. And he can\xe2\x80\x99t kill me.\n(to Shingen)\nTake as long as you like, baldy. I \ngot all the time in the world. 114.'b'No more composure, Shingen freaks- charging at Logan \nwith everything he has. Logan moves back, sideways, \naround, absorbing every move in Shingen\xe2\x80\x99s arsenal. \nThe Lord of the House Yashida is reduced to a primal \nshrieking maniac. Logan is the picture of calm. Then: \nSNAP \nTime stops. Shingen holds up his family sword, the \nblade snapped in two. He throws it, draws his short \nsword and goes after Logan again. But now it\xe2\x80\x99s just \nsad. Logan has reach on him. Shingen can\xe2\x80\x99t win. \nSHINGEN\n(to Samurai)\nTogether. We take him together. \nSamurai cannot hide his surprise.\nSAMURAI\nThat is not the-\nSHINGEN\nThey can choose another champion.\nLOGAN\n(to Shingen re: Samurai)\nSooner or later you\xe2\x80\x99ll have to face \nhim.

Kill me \nand what will you be? Master of The \nBlack Clan? Perhaps. But what name? \nWhat house? You will still be \nliving in the shadow. Without a \nfather to call your son you are, \nand always will be, nothing. 115.'b'CLOSE ON: Samurai - the eyes behind his mask show he\xe2\x80\x99s been \nhit on a gut level. \nSAMURAI\nI am nothing now. What difference \ndoes it make? \nSHINGEN\nSwear your loyalty to me. Here and \nnow. I will acknowledge you as my \nson.  I will name you my successor. \nMariko is stunned. Samurai slowly removes his helmet to \nbetter hear words he has waited for all his life.\nSAMURAI\nAnd The Black Clan?\nSHINGEN\nYou will swear off any claim to The \nBlack Clan until I am dead and \ngone. Then you will earn the right \nto be chosen, just as I have done. \nYou will fight for your father\xe2\x80\x99s \nprize just as I do now. With a \nchampion... Chosen by The Clan. \nLOGAN\nUse your head, kid. He\xe2\x80\x99s sucking \nyou in. Don\xe2\x80\x99t do it. \nSHINGEN\nThe Empire my father left will be \nnothing compared to the one I leave \nyou. I will extend the shadow of \nThe Black Clan until it covers the \nEarth. Bow to me... and in time it \nwill all be yours. \nSamurai considers things very carefully. Logan \ngrimaces. He\xe2\x80\x99s in the shit now. After a beat: \nSAMURAI\nI accept your terms... Father. \nShingen smiles. Logan wince, nods to Shingen.\nLOGAN\nWell played. \nSAMURAI \nOn one condition. 116.'b'LOGAN\nUh oh. \nSAMURAI\nI must have a guarantee.\nSHINGEN\nI give you my word of honor. What \nbetter guarantee is there.\nSAMURAI\nThe word you gave to my mother? \nBefore she killed herself? Your \nword means nothing to me. I pledge \nmy sword to you here and now, \nfather. But... I must be the sole \nheir to the House Yashida. The sole \nliving heir. \nAll eyes shift to Mariko now. Terrified, she looks to Logan, \nthen to Shingen. He looks at his daughter with deep pity, a \ntinge of regret. Then he sizes up Samurai, Logan, his overall \nchances...\nSHINGEN\nVery well..\nMARIKO\nFather-\nSHINGEN\nKill her.\nIn a flash, Samurai turns his blade on Mariko.\nIn that same instant: Logan attacks Samurai. \nIn that same instant: Shingen attacks Logan. \nLOGAN\nLITTLE HELP HERE.\nYukio springs into action. Viper cuts her off, \ndrawing the knife she sued on Logan, that familiar \namber oil dripping from the blade. Yukio forgoes \nweapons of any kind and sticks with hand-to-hand. \nFive  bodies dance around Mariko in a blur of blades, \nfists and feet. Logan is taking hits now, fighting a \ntwo front war - Shingen trying to hit his vitals, \nSamurai trying to get past him to kill Mariko. The \nresulting frustration leads to anger, angerturns to \nrage. His rage boils over and Logan goes completely, \ntotally, utterly117.'b'Berserk\nLogan swings his sword at Samurai\xe2\x80\x99s chest, the blade \nexploding like glass. Samurai\xe2\x80\x99s armor holds, but the \nforce of the blow momentarily staggers him as: \nShingen swings his blade at Logan\xe2\x80\x99s neck for the \nkill. To his horror, Logan spins and catches the \nspeeding blade with his bare hands. It cuts his \nflesh, but not his adamantium bones. Meanwhile: \nSamurai closes on Logan from behind, distracted when: \nYukio throws a roundhouse kick to the side of Viper\xe2\x80\x99s \nhead, dropping her before firing a scalpel at \nSamurai, slicing his cheek. Enraged, Samurai attacks \nYukio. She just barely stays ahead of his sword as: \nLogan grips Shingen\xe2\x80\x99s glade, feeling no pain, \nenraged. Shingen is scared of him now. He lets his \nsword go with one hand and reaches into his robe, \nPULLING OUT THE GREEN DAGGER. THE DEATH BLOW. \nBut as he lashes out with the dagger, Logan tears the \nsword from Shingen\xe2\x80\x99s grasp and clubs him over the \nhead with the handle. Shingen goes down. \nCLOSE ON: The green dagger tumbles into the grass as: \nLogan throws Shingen\xe2\x80\x99s sword, the adamantium visible \nthrough his flayed palms. Samurai sees his moment. \nForgetting Yukio, he stabs Logan in the back. Logan \nscreams and turns, striking the sizzling blade with \nhis elbow and ripping it from Samurai\xe2\x80\x99s hand. The \nblade stays wedged in Logan\xe2\x80\x99s body, crackling. \nViper staggers to her feet and lunges at Yukio. Yukio \ncatches her. They Grapple for Viper\xe2\x80\x99s knife as: \nLogan roars and kicks Samurai square in the chest. \nSamurai\xe2\x80\x99s heavy armor adds to his momentum and he \nstagers back and falls as: \nViper sweeps Yukio\xe2\x80\x99s legs and drives her to the \nground, jumping on top of her and coming down with \nthe knife in both hands as:\nLogan turns to Mariko.\nLOGAN (CONT\xe2\x80\x99D)\nPULL IT OUT. DO IT.118.'b'He turns his back to her. Mariko can\xe2\x80\x99t bring herself \nto touch the weapon. \nCLOSE ON: A drop of poison dangles from the tip of \nViper\xe2\x80\x99s trembling blade, just above Yukio\xe2\x80\x99s eye. As: \nSamurai gets to his feet and heads for Logan. \nLOGAN (CONT\xe2\x80\x99D)\nDO IT. DO IT NOW. \nMariko tears the blade from Logan\xe2\x80\x99s back. In one \nfluid motion he spins, snatches the sword from her \nhand and comes back around to meet Samurai. \nWA-CRACK - The charged blade hits the charged armor. \nSamurai and Logan are both blasted back. The \nresulting, waist-high shock-wave of energy knocks \nMariko flat and blasts Viper off of Yukio. \nSilence. \nSamurai - his armor no longer charged - is the first \nto stir, shaken and dazed, but protected by his own \narmor from real harm. Logan, meanwhile, struggles to \nsit up, overwhelmed by his wounds. \nSamurai hauls him up by his neck.\nWHACK- Enraged, he punches Logan with his armored \nfist over and over, squeezing Logan\xe2\x80\x99s throat with \nhis other hand. Logan\xe2\x80\x99s neck snaps back repeatedly \nuntil: \nSCHUNK - A scream of agony. Samurai drops on his \nknees, clutching the upper half of his right arm. \nCLOSE ON: The severed forearm of Samurai\xe2\x80\x99s glimmering \narmor lying in the grass.\nCLOSE ON: Samurai\xe2\x80\x99s sword still clutched in Logan\xe2\x80\x99s \nhand. That is until Logan throws it. \nLOGAN (CONT\xe2\x80\x99D)\nMaybe now you can teach.\nMARIKO\nLOGAN.\nHe turns, but too late.\nSCHUNK- And Logan gasps. PULL BACK TO REVEAL: 119.'b'Shingen, his broken family sword buried up to the \nhilt in Logan\xe2\x80\x99s belly. He savors it, pulls the blade \nout and lets Logan drop down on all fours. \nLogan is badly wounded, unable to get up. Shingen \nstands over him, triumphant. He rests his sword on \nthe back of Logan\xe2\x80\x99s neck, much like his father did \nseventy years ago, marking his spot. \nSHINGEN\nOne just needs to be...precise.\nHe raises the sword to strike and...\nYukio attacks him. Shingen senses her coming, turns \nand back-hands her. Yukio is out cold. \nShingen raises the sword above his head. Logan is too \nweak to resist. Then Shingen freezes. His face \nchanging when he sees: \nSHADOWS moving at the top of the garden wall. Dozens \nof them, rising one by one. Silent. More shadows \nemerge from the garden. Suddenly, they are surrounded \non all sides, not by some Men of the Black Clan, but \nall of them. Hundreds. Watching silently. Waiting...\nANGLE ON: Mariko coming to, seeing her father over \nLogan, ready to behead him. She looks around, sees a \ndagger in the grass. She grabs it. Meanwhile: \nSHINGEN (CONT\xe2\x80\x99D)\nIn the end, Logan-san ... you were \nworthy. \nMARIKO\nFather-\nHe turns, catching  Mariko\xe2\x80\x99s hand before she can stab \nhim. She twists her wrist and shakes the dagger from \nher grasp. Then he shoves her back. He turns quickly \nto finish the job, taking the sword in both hands...\nAND NOTICES A SMALL CUT ON THE BACK OF HIS HAND - \nsuperficial really - between his thumb and \nforefinger. A trace of pale green. He sees the green \ndagger in the grass. The dagger Mariko was holding.\nHis hand trembles, convulses. The skin blisters and \nbubbles. The bubbles crawl up his arm, under his \nrobe. He drops his sword, puts a hand to his throat \nas his blood boils. As his eyes turn bright red. \nAnd Shingen collapses. Dead. 120.'b'Mariko rushes to Logan as Yukio comes to. She crawls over to \nViper, lying face down on the ground. Yukio rolls her over. \nViper has fallen on her own knife. \nMariko helps Logan to his feet as his wounds slowly heal. \nMeanwhile The Black Clan slowly gathers around him. As \nalways, without a sound.\nAt the front of the mass of assassins is the Monk. He kneels \nbefore Logan and the others do the same. It is a solemn \nmoment. \nSAMURAI\n(through bitter tears)\nYou have been chosen. You are \nMaster of the Black Clan.\nLOGAN\nBut... I didn\xe2\x80\x99t kill him.\n(to the Monk)\nI didn\xe2\x80\x99t kill Shingen. Mariko did. \nNo winner, no master.\nThe Monk just bows solemnly, waiting.\nSAMURAI\nYou have been chosen, Logan. They \nawait your command.\nLOGAN\nNo. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want this. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t ask \nfor it.\nYUKIO\nThen don\xe2\x80\x99t give them a command. \nWhat difference does it make.\nLOGAN\n(re: Shingen and Samurai)\nLook at them. There\xe2\x80\x99ll always be a \nchallenger. I\xe2\x80\x99ll be the one who has \nto kill them. One day, one of them \nwill win. Maybe someone even worse \nthan Shingen. No. I won\xe2\x80\x99t do it.\n(to Yukio)\nTake Mariko. Get her out of here. \nMariko holds on to him.\nMARIKO\nWhat about you?\nLOGAN\nI\xe2\x80\x99m gonna deal with them. 121.'b'Mariko sees too many killers to count. Logan and the \nMonk share a look, an understanding between warriors.\nMARIKO\nNo. Logan, please. \nLOGAN\nThey\xe2\x80\x99re a curse, Mariko. They\xe2\x80\x99ve \nbeena cruse on your people for two \nthousand years. It ends tonight. \nMARIKO\nLogan-\nLOGAN\nDo as I say. Please. Go.\nMariko knows there is no convincing Logan. Yukio \ntakes her by the arm and leads her away.\nMARIKIO\xe2\x80\x99S P.O.V.of Logan standing at the center of an \narmy of Assassins, who live only to kill. Samurai \nrocks gently on his knees a few feet away, clutching \nwhat\xe2\x80\x99s left of his arm his instrument. \nANGLE ON: Logan and the Monk, staring at one another. \nThe Monk seems to read Logan\xe2\x80\x99s mind. The Monk nods. \nINT.

YASHIDA STRONGHOLD - DRIVEWAY - NIGHT\nMariko helps Yukio into the car and shuts the door, \nwalking around to the other side. She gasps: \nANGLE ON: Logan, standing in the doorway of the \nstronghold, not a scratch on him. He walks toward \nMariko. She runs to him. They embrace. Then: 122.'b'MARIKO\nWhat did you do? \nLOGAN\nI\xe2\x80\x99m Master of the Black Clan. I \nspoke. They obeyed.\nMARIKO\nWhat did you say?\nLOGAN\n... Seppuku.\nEXT.

I wanted \nto be here to say goodbye.\nLogan is touched. Another figure emerges from the fog: \nMariko, as stunning as ever. He extends a hand: \nLOGAN\nShip\xe2\x80\x99s leaving, come on. \nMARIKO\nI\xe2\x80\x99m not going.\nStunned pause. Zen bends his head.

Yukio looks away. Sinatra puts a comforting \nhand on her shoulder. \nMariko turns and walks back to the car, wiping tears from her \neyes as the fog swallows her. Logan turns to Zen who holds a \nfamiliar object in the hands. \nTHE BOX left to him by Yashida.

The underside of the panels house a variety of hand-built ASTRONOMICAL DEVICES, which now point at the sky. JANE FOSTER (late 20\'s) pops her head through the roof. She positions a MAGNETOMETER, so its monitor calibrates with the constellations above. It appears to be cobbled together from spare parts of other devices.\nJANE\nHurry!\nWe hear a loud BANG followed by muffled CURSING from below.

Passionately longing to know how they are connected to the heavens.\nWe pull away from the planet, widening, past other worlds, cosmic debris -- leaving first our solar system, then our galaxy.\nHEIMDALL (V.O.)\nIn ages past, they looked to us as gods, for indeed so many times we saved them from calamity. \n(MORE)7."b"We tried to show them how their \nworld was but one of the Nine Realms of the Cosmos, linked to all others by the branches of Yggdrasil...

His wife FRIGGA sits at a vanity and tries different earrings before the mirror.\nODIN\nDo you think he's ready?\nFRIGGA\nHe thinks he is. He has his father's confidence.\nODIN\nHe'll need his father's wisdom.\nFRIGGA\nAnd his humility? Odin reacts.\nFRIGGA (CONT'D)\nThor won't be alone. Loki will be at his side to give him counsel. Have faith in your sons.\nODIN\nYes, but Thor's still a boy. He could be a great King... Odin stops, notices HIS HAND SHAKING. It seems to be out of synch temporally with the rest of the world, leaving a trail as it moves. He stares at it determinedly, concentrating, trying to stop the strange event through the force of his sheer will.\nFinally, the occurrence subsides, his hand normal once more.

Banners hang on either side to form a corridor down the middle of the fire lit room. Giant doors open at one end. A huge figure silhouetted against the bright light beyond walks forward. In slo-mo, we recognize the unmistakable shape of the God of Thunder. Hammer in hand, he reaches the end of a raised platform. An ATTENDANT hands the figure a goblet of wine. He downs it quickly, hurls it towards the fire directly below.\nTHOR\nAnother!\nThe cup smashes, the alcohol causes the fire to glow intensely -- and, for a moment, brightly lit, and seen full length, like a King to be, is THE MIGHTY THOR. He proceeds down stops, past camera, and down the center of the Hall. We follow from behind and see at the other end, massively shadowed on one of the great banners, the shape of two great horns. As Thor approaches, the horn shapes move, and then, from the shadows at the side, emerges LOKI, wearing his horned headpiece. Like Thor, he is dressed for a great ceremony. They stand by a brazier at the foot of steps that lead up to the crowded throne room.\nLOKI\n(TO THOR)\nNervous, brother?10."b"THOR\nHave you ever known me to be \nnervous?\nLOKI\nThere was the time in Nornheim...\nTHOR\nThat wasn't nerves, brother. It was the rage of battle. How else could I have fought my way through a hundred warriors and pulled us out alive?\nThe Attendant approaches with another goblet of wine for Thor.\nLOKI\nAs I recall, I was the one who veiled us in smoke to ease our escape.\nTHOR\nSome do battle, others just do tricks.\nThe Attendant stifles a laugh. Loki notices, doesn't like it. He gestures towards the goblet in the Attendant's hand. EELS pour over the sides of the goblet, slithering out and across the terrified Attendant's hand. He SCREAMS, hurls the goblet to the ground. Loki chuckles.\nTHOR (CONT'D)\nLoki...\nLoki gestures to the writhing eels on the ground. They turn back to spilled wine, the illusion shattered.\nTHOR (CONT'D)\nNow that was just a waste of good wine.\nLOKI\nJust a bit of fun.\n(to the Attendant)\nRight, my friend?

You're my brother and my friend. Sometimes I'm envious, but never doubt that I love you.\nThor searches his brother's face, sees no trace of irony. He's either speaking from his heart or he's a very, very good liar. Maybe both. Thor puts an appreciative hand on his brother's shoulder.\nTHOR\nThank you.\nThe two brothers take in the moment a beat, then:\nLOKI\nGive us a kiss.\nTHOR\nStop.\nThor makes the final adjustments to his ceremonial wear.\nTHOR (CONT'D)\nHow do I look?\nLOKI\nLike a king.\nThey hear the blast of a CEREMONIAL HORN.\nLOKI (CONT'D)\nIt's time.\nTHOR\nYou go ahead.12."b"Loki casts him a wary look.\nTHOR (CONT'D)\nI'll be along.

As he does, he's surprised to find a stray GRAPE stuck in the beard. He pulls it out, looks around, then eagerly pops it into his mouth and gobbles it down. FANDRAL checks his reflection in a mirror, smooths out his moustache, gives himself a dashing smile. A PRETTY MAIDEN holds the mirror before him, as other MAIDENS look on dreamily.\nFANDRAL\nThank you, love.\n(to the Maidens)\nFANDRAL (CONT'D)\nNow who'd like to polish my sword for me?\nThe giddy Maidens eagerly raise their hands. HOGUN stands staring ahead grimly, his hands folded in front of him, amidst the hustle and bustle of the ATTENDANTS and the ceremony preparations going on around him. A HELPFUL ATTENDANT approaches him and starts to polish his armor. Hogun turns his head, gives him a look. Intimidated, the Attendant quickly backs away. From behind, we see a WOMAN IN CEREMONIAL ARMOR take off her SWORD and set it on a table, then her SHIELD, then several HIDDEN DAGGERS and small, yet intimidating WEAPONS. We reveal that it's SIF, looking radiant. She eyes the weapons on the table.\nSIF\n(to the weapons)\nI'll miss you.\nINT. THRONE ROOM - DAY 18 18 18\nColorful CEREMONIAL BANNERS of the Nine Realms adorn the room, crowded with AESIR and REPRESENTATIVES from across Yggdrasil, all BUZZING with excitement.

They are:\nTHE WARRIORS THREEVOLSTAGG has the girth and strength of a Sumo wrestler, with \noversized passions to match. 13."b"FANDRAL, the consummate swashbuckler, is agile, charismatic, \nand nattily dressed.

I'm not nervous!\nFRIGGA\nYou may be able to fool the rest of\nASGARD --\nTHOR\n...but never you.

She smiles.\nFRIGGA (CONT'D)\nNow don't keep your father waiting. Frigga leaves.\nINT. THRONE ROOM - DAY 20 20 20\nSif and the Warriors Three still wait before the crowd. Loki and Frigga enter. Loki takes his place at the front of the hall alongside the others. With another blast of the horn, the crowd goes silent as the EINHERJAR HONOR GUARD moves into formation. They part to reveal --\nODIN\nSitting atop his throne, clad in full ceremonial armor. He holds his spear GUNGNIR before him. Any trace of weakness in him is gone now. He exudes all the power and majesty of a Ruler of Asgard. Frigga joins him at his side. He looks around the hall, casts a glance over to the Warriors. Thor is nowhere to be seen. Odin looks to Loki. \n(MORE)15."b"Loki shrugs. Odin isn't pleased. A \nmurmur spreads through the crowd.\nVOLSTAGG\n(sotto, to Loki)\nWhere is he?\nLOKI\nHe said he'd be along. Sif realizes the truth, shakes her head in disapproval.\nVOLSTAGG\nWhat?\nSIF\nHe wants to make an entrance.\nFANDRAL\nWell, if he doesn't show up soon, he shouldn't bother. Odin looks like he's ready to feed him to his ravens.\nLOKI\nI wouldn't worry. Father will forgive him. He always does.\nJust then, at the back of the hall, up the steps from the lower level --\nMJOLNIR\nRoars up into the hall, Thor strides cockily into the hall behind it, catching it behind his back. The CROWD erupts in CHEERS. Thor spins his hammer with a flourish, holds it up before the crowd, basking in the moment, relishing the adoration, whipping his audience up into a frenzy.\nSIF\nOh, please.\nOdin watches from the front, not liking this showy display.\nINT. VAULT - DAY 21 21 21\nAs the sound of the cheers echo from above, the odd, cold \nbreeze picks up in the Vault. The Guards rub their limbs to warm themselves. They grow increasingly uneasy, sensing something's not right. ODIN (CONT'D)\n16."b"They exchange a look, then walk the length of the Vault's \nhallway to its end, where a CASKET sits undisturbed upon a pedestal. LARGE SHADOWS suddenly loom over them. They look up and SHOUT in terror as they raise their weapons.\nINT. THRONE ROOM - DAY 22 22 22\nThor finishes stirring up the crowd, then reaches the front \nof the room, kneels on one knee before his mother and father. Frigga casts him an admonishing glance. Thor winks up at her. She can't help but smile. Odin strikes Gungnir upon the ground with a deafening BOOM. The crowd falls silent. Odin speaks with quiet, effortless authority. He raises Gungnir before him.\nODIN\nGungnir. Its aim is true, its power strong. With it I have defended Asgard and the lives of the innocent across the Nine Realms since the time of the Great Beginning. And though the day has come for a new King to wield his own weapon -- that duty remains the same. Thor Odinson, my heir, my first-born.\nODIN (CONT'D)\nSo long entrusted with this mighty hammer, Mjolnir. Forged in the heart of a dying star, from the sacred metal of Uru. Only one may lift it. Only one is worthy. Who wields this hammer commands the lightning and the storm. Its power has no equal -- as a weapon, to destroy, or as a tool, to build. It is a fit companion for a King.\nINT. VAULT - DAY 23 23 23\nThe bodies of the Guards are flung to the Vault's floor, now strewn with ice. We don't see their attackers clearly, just catch glimpses of them in the shadows -- but they are large and BLUE-SKINNED. One of the creatures lifts the Casket off its stand and turns to go. But, as they do, the intricate latticework behind the Casket starts to separate and retract, revealing something standing in the shadows behind it. As the creatures walk away, a fiery glow rises behind them. They turn back around. Now it's their turn to SCREAM.\nINT. THRONE ROOM - DAY 24 24 24\nThe Ceremony continues.17."b"ODIN\nToday I entrust you with the \ngreatest honor in all the Nine Realms. The sacred throne of Asgard. I have sacrificed much to achieve peace. So, too, must a new generation sacrifice to maintain that peace. Responsibility, duty, honor. These are not merely virtues to which we must aspire. They are essential to every soldier and to every King. The Crowd and the Warriors Three start to shiver and rub their limbs for warmth in the increasingly cold air of the hall.\nThor turns back to face his father. Odin looks upon his son with pride.\nODIN (CONT'D)\nThor Odinson, do you swear to guard the Nine Realms?\nTHOR\nI swear.\nODIN\nDo you swear to preserve the peace?\nTHOR\nI swear.\nODIN\nDo you swear to cast aside all selfish ambition and pledge yourself only to the good of all the Realms?\nBeat.\nTHOR\nI swear.\nODIN\nThen on this day, I, Odin Allfather, proclaim you-- Odin hesitates, noticing a strange sight before him.

Shattered and melting ICE is strewn about the floor. We don't see the blue-skinned bodies of the Frost Giants clearly, just catch glimpses of their twisted and smoldering remains on the floor. They've just lost a savage battle. Badly. Amidst them, shrouded in shadow, stands the black metal creature, a fiery glow coming from within it. It is THE DESTROYER. It holds the Casket in its hands.\nSIF\nThe Destroyer.\nVOLSTAGG\n(AWED)\nI thought it was but a legend. Odin steps in behind the Asgardians, as the Destroyer sets the Casket back on its pedestal. It moves back to its post, the faint, FIERY GLOW extinguishes within it. Fandral looks around the Vault, ill at ease.\nFANDRAL\nI've never been inside the Vault before.

BANQUET HALL - DAY 26 26 26\nThor stands in the empty hall, bearing the signs of the festivities cancelled due to the events of the day. Anger and frustration rising within him, Thor upends one of the massive tables.

Volstagg surveys the overturned tables and food, aghast.21."b"VOLSTAGG\nWhat's this -- ?!\nHOGUN\nI told you they'd cancel it.\nFANDRAL\nWe thought that was just you being \nyour normal cheery self. Volstagg looks about the floor, despairing.\nVOLSTAGG\nAll this food -- so innocent, cast to the ground. It breaks the heart!\nThor strides away from them to the far end of the hall. Loki calmly moves towards him.\nTHOR\nIt's unwise to be in my company right now, brother.\nLOKI\nWho said I was wise?\nTHOR\n(re: the empty hall)\nThis was to be my day of triumph.\nLOKI\nIt will come. In time.\n(ADMITS)\nIf it's any consolation, I think you're right. About the Frost Giants, about Laufey, everything. If a few of them could penetrate the defenses of Asgard once, who's to say they won't try again. Next time with an army?\nTHOR\nYes, exactly!\nLOKI\nBut there's nothing we can do without defying Father. Thor considers this, looks at his hammer, a gleam in his eye. Loki can guess what he's thinking, grows concerned.\nLOKI (CONT'D)\nNo... stop there! I know that look!22."b"THOR\nIt's the only way to ensure the \nsafety of our borders.\nLOKI\nIt's madness!\nVOLSTAGG\nMadness? What sort of madness?\nLOKI\nNothing!

Loki slips away from the group, speaks to a nearby GUARD. Hogun notices.\nTHOR\nWe must first find a way to get past Heimdall.\nVOLSTAGG\nThat will be no easy task. It's said the Gatekeeper can see a single dew drop fall from a blade of grass a thousand worlds away.\nFANDRAL\nAnd he can hear a cricket passing gas in Niffelheim.\nVOLSTAGG\nJest not!

They ride along the most astounding path in this Realm or any other --\nTHE RAINBOW BRIDGE.Wide and flat, it runs straight out from Odin's palace to \nthe mists and black void of space beyond. In the distance far ahead, the Bridge continues on until it reaches Heimdall's Observatory.\nEXT. HEIMDALL'S OBSERVATORY - DAY 29 29 29\nThe band draws near the Observatory, where HEIMDALL himself, \nGatekeeper of Asgard, stands at his post on the Bridge before them, blocking their way, staring them down. There is something other-worldly about him, even for this Realm. He holds a massive sword in front of him, his stern, intimidating face virtually concealed by armor. Something glints beneath his visor, like twinkling stars.\nLOKI\nKeep your weapons sheathed and your mouths closed. This is going to take subtlety and sincerity, not brute strength. Leave it to me. Loki dismounts and steps forward.\nLOKI (CONT'D)\nGOOD HEIMDALL--\nHEIMDALL\nYou're not dressed warmly enough.

Heimdall stares him down.\nHEIMDALL\nFor ages have I guarded Asgard and kept it safe from those who would do it harm. In all that time, never has an enemy slipped by my watch -- until this day. I wish to know how that happened.\nTHOR\nThen tell no one where we've gone until we've returned. Thor walks past Heimdall as the Gatekeeper lets the group pass. Volstagg walks beside the frustrated Loki, needles him.\nVOLSTAGG\nWhat happened? Your silver tongue turn to lead?\nLOKI\nGet me off this bridge before it cracks under your girth. Volstagg and Fandral share a laugh.(THEN) (CONT'D)\n27."b"INT. HEIMDALL'S OBSERVATORY - DAY 30 30 30\nThor and the others enter the Observatory, step onto a \nplatform. Heimdall climbs into the large control apparatus at the center of the room and readies the Observatory.\nHEIMDALL\nBe warned. I will honor my sworn oath to protect this Realm as its Gatekeeper. If your return threatens the safety of Asgard, Bifrost will remain closed to you.

The \nObservatory's giant turret swings around, aims toward a section of space. As a final step, Heimdall plunges his sword deeper into the control panel. The great turret FIRES, the RAINBOW LIGHT of Bifrost energy blasts out of it. The Bifrost opens at the end of the platform upon which Thor and his five comrades stand.\nHEIMDALL\nAll is ready. You may pass.\nVOLSTAGG\nCouldn't you just leave the bridge open for us?\nHEIMDALL\nTo keep this bridge open would unleash the full power of the Bifrost and destroy Jotunheim with you upon it.28."b"VOLSTAGG\nAh. Never mind, then. Thor starts \ntowards the Bifrost, turns back to the others, grins.\nTHOR\nCome on. Don't be bashful. The others join him at his side, then step towards the Bifrost. Their bodies stretch towards the maelstrom, changing shape, as if every atom of their being is being elongated by the pull of it. In an instant, they're jerked off the platform and inside the vortex.\nEXT. BIFROST LANDING SITE (JOTUNHEIM) - DAY 33 33 33\nA hole in the sky rips open, and the Bifrost comes shooting out of it. Snow flurries up when the Bifrost hits, as Thor and his band touch down. RUNES from the Bifrost are imprinted on the ice around them.\nVolstagg loses his footing, falling backwards. Thor quickly \ngrabs him by the belt. We see the warrior dangling precariously on the edge of a sheer cliff on the planet's inner ring, opening up to the black abyss of space beyond.\nTHOR\nCome on, big fella. Up...! With an effort, Thor pulls the burly warrior back onto the ice and, tremendously relieved, he proclaims:\nVOLSTAGG\nThis belt! This belt is now my lucky belt! I will never remove it! Even when bathing!\nFANDRAL\nYou bathe?\nThor and the others turn and stare out in horror and wonder at the frozen alien wasteland before them. The whole planet is a massive flattened ring of jagged ice, slowly breaking apart. Huge CHUNKS OF ICE calve away from its outer edges and float off into space. The planet's icy surface cracks and melts as far as the eye can see.

We could turn \nright around, hop back to Asgard, share a mug by the fire. Could be nice.\nThor ignore him, heads off. Loki looks around, anxious.\nLOKI\nPerhaps we should wait. Thor turns back to his brother.\nTHOR\nFor what?\nLOKI\nTo survey the enemy. To gauge their strengths and weaknesses from a distance.\nVOLSTAGG\nI'm liking that. Gauging, surveying.

JOTUNHEIM - DAY 34 34 34\nThe group trudges behind Thor across the frozen wasteland, shielding themselves from the howling wind and cold. Loki looks around them, anxious. Volstagg shivers. Thor, invigorated, turns back to his comrades.\nTHOR\nIt feels good, doesn't it? To be together again, adventuring on another world?\nFANDRAL\nAdventuring? Is that what we're doing?30."b"THOR\nWhat would you call it?\nFANDRAL\nFreezing.\nVOLSTAGG\nStarving.\nSIF\nWhining.\nTHOR\nHow about a song to lift our \nspirits?\nThe others groan.\nHOGUN\nNo, not that!\nSIF\nPlease don't make us sing again!\nFANDRAL\nIf I have to listen to Volstagg's singing voice one more time, I'll fall on my own sword!\nSIF\nWell, now I'm on board. She and Thor share a grin. The party reaches the edge of the city -- its ancient structures of jade and ice melting and crumbling, ravaged by warfare long ago. A TEMPLE lies before them, across a central plaza.\nSIF (CONT'D)\nWhere are they?\nTHOR\nHiding. As cowards always do. Thor leads the others onwards towards the central plaza. Loki reluctantly follows. They don't notice as SHADOWY FIGURES move in the shadows of the structures nearby.\nEXT. CENTRAL PLAZA - DAY 35 35 35\nThe party reaches the plaza. They sense the Frost Giants in the shadows and crevices, surrounding them now on all sides. 31."b'The Asgardians reach for the hilts of their weapons. A JOTUN \nSENTRY calls to him.\nJOTUN SENTRY\nWhat is your business here, Asgardian?\nThe Jotun\'s voice itself sounds like cracking ice.\nTHOR\nI speak only to your King. Not to his foot soldiers.\nJOTUN VOICE (O.S.)\nThen speak.\nThor turns towards the source in a balcony of the temple, where LAUFEY sits, veiled in shadow, behind a cascading waterfall. The Jotun King is ancient, noble, powerful -- too proud to reveal even a hint of the years of suffering he and his people have endured.\nLAUFEY\nI am Laufey, King of this Realm.\nTHOR\nAnd I am--\nLAUFEY\nWe know who you are, Odinson. Why have you brought the stench of your blood into my world?\nTHOR\nI demand answers. Laufey stands, sizing up Thor, tries to piece this together.\nLAUFEY\nYou "demand?"\xc2\xac\xc3\xb9\nTHOR\nHow did your people get into Asgard?\nLAUFEY\nThe house of Odin is full of traitors.\nSif and the Warriors Three exchange a puzzled look, disturbed by the Jotun King\'s words.32.'b"THOR\nDo not dishonor my father's name \nwith your lies.\nLAUFEY\nYour father is a murderer and a thief. He stole what was ours, and left our world in ruins. We have the right to reclaim the Casket.\nTHOR\nNot when you'd use it to make war against other Realms. Laufey laughs, cold, mocking.\nLAUFEY\nAnd why have you come here? To make peace? You long for battle. You crave it. I see you for what you are, Thor Odinson. Nothing but a boy, trying to prove himself a man.\nTHOR\nThis boy has grown tired of your mockery.\nThor takes a step towards Laufey. The other Jotuns step in front of Thor, blocking his path. We finally see the Frost Giants now -- terrifying, blue-skinned, standing eight feet tall. Loki moves next to his brother and quietly implores him.\nLOKI\nThor, stop and think. Look around you. We are outnumbered.\nTHOR\nKnow your place, brother...\nLAUFEY\nYou should listen to his counsel. You know not what your actions would unleash.\nLaufey steps out of the shadows.\nLAUFEY (CONT'D)\nBut I do. Go now, while I still allow it.\nThor simmers. Loki speaks up.33."b'LOKI\nWe will accept your most gracious \noffer.\nThe others look to Thor imploringly. Thor stares Laufey down a beat -- then relents. He turns to leave. His comrades breathe a sigh of relief and follow, when a Frost Giant nearby mutters under his breath.\nJOTUN\nRun back home, little princess. Thor stops in his tracks. Loki goes white. He knows what\'s coming.\nLOKI\nDamn.\nIn one quick move, Thor pulls Mjolnir, swings it, and KNOCKS the Jotun clear across the plaza. The Asgardians reluctantly draw their weapons, gather into a circle around Thor. Volstagg looks around at the angry Jotuns approaching them.\nVOLSTAGG\nSilly hammer! Has a mind of its own!\nICE forms on the Jotuns\' bodies, creating a FROZEN ARMOR around them, extending off the ends of their arms like SWORDS. One Giant does so directly in front of Fandral.\nFANDRAL\nI\'m hoping that\'s just decorative. Thor leaves the circle of Asgardians, swings at another Frost Giant. His comrades form another circle around him, separating him from the Jotuns, as he whirls his hammer around once and catches it with a cocky grin. He\'s enjoying this.\nTHOR\nNext!\nFandral calls to Volstagg and Hogun.\nFANDRAL\nWell? What move, do you think?\nVOLSTAGG\nI say we use "The Norn\'s Revenge."\xc2\xac\xc3\xb934.'b'FANDRAL\nAt this close range? I think "The \nAlfheim Lunge"\xc2\xac\xc3\xb9 is a better move.\nVOLSTAGG\n(DISGUSTED)\nMaybe if they were three feet tall! No! How about "The Randy Valkyrie"\xc2\xac\xc3\xb9?\nHOGUN\nShut up!\nThor takes out yet another Frost Giant, then all hell breaks loose as the Asgardians and Jotuns begin to battle. A Jotun backs Hogun up against a wall of ice. As the Giant hurls an ice blade fist at him, the grim warrior swings his mace over his head, embedding it into the ice wall, and hoists himself up, dodging the Giant\'s blow and leaping over him. Hogun takes out a second approaching Frost Giant, spins back, dodges a swing from the first, then pounds the Jotun with his mace. Nearby, Sif expertly stabs one Jotun after another with her double-bladed staff. One knocks her viciously to the ground.\nSIF\nIf you don\'t treat me like a lady, I won\'t act like a lady! She takes out the Jotun. Loki backs away from an approaching Jotun, finds himself at the edge of a deep crevasse. The Giant sees he\'s vulnerable, swipes at him. But the Jotun\'s arm passes right through him. The Giant stands there, confused, when THE REAL LOKI comes out from behind a structure and shoves the Giant into the crevasse below. The false Loki dissipates into nothingness.\nLOKI\n(to the falling Giant)\nPathetic.\nHe turns back to the battle. Two Jotuns come at him from either side. He lets two daggers fly, felling both Giants at once. Laufey nods to one of his guards -- a massive Jotun BRUTE. The Brute leaps down from the balcony, icing himself up, then punches his giant fist into the ice beneath his feet. It\'s a long-range attack, causing PILLARS OF ICE to explode out in front of Hogun, sending the grim warrior flying back. Across the plaza, Thor easily dispatches some Jotuns.35.'b"THOR\nCome on! At least make it a \nchallenge for me! He sees the Brute coming at him. The huge Jotun lands a tremendous blow, sending Thor back across the ice. Thor rises, grins.\nTHOR (CONT'D)\nNow that's more like it! He throws Mjolnir with all his strength, knocking the Brute head over heels. Thor raises his hand. Mjolnir slows in mid-air, then flies back to his grasp.\nTHOR (CONT'D)\n(re: the fallen Brute)\nUgly and stupid. Sif takes out a couple Frost Giants, but she's knocked to the ground by another. It raises its weapon above her. Hogun sees Sif in danger. He pulls a HIDDEN KNIFE from his sleeve and hurls it at Sif's attacker, hitting him square in the chest. The Jotun falls dead.\nSIF\n(to Hogun, re: knife)\nI'm so glad I taught him how to do that!\nVolstagg grapples with a Frost Giant, getting a couple good hits in.\nVOLSTAGG\nYou may want to put some ice on that!\nThe Frost Giant fights back, but Volstagg manages to grip in a headlock just as another comes up on him from behind. Volstagg fends him off, then turns the first one loose.\nVOLSTAGG (CONT'D)\nYou may be taller, but I'm wider! Volstagg launches his mighty belly at the Jotun and sends him flying.\nAnother Jotun grabs Volstagg, squeezing him tightly and sending him crashing to the ground.36."b"VOLSTAGG (CONT'D)\nIt's not too late for you to \nsurrender.\nVolstagg recovers and fights on. The Jotun grabs Volstagg's bare arm. The warrior's skin begins to freeze from the Jotun's grasp, a BLACKNESS spreading from it, necrotizing Volstagg's flesh. The warrior SHOUTS in pain.\nVolstagg head-butts the Frost Giant, shattering the Jotun's \nice helmet and dropping him to the ground. Winded, he takes a seat upon one of the fallen Jotun's bodies to catch his breath. As the battle rages around him, he opens a secret compartment at the end of his weapon, takes out a small FLASK. Volstagg grimaces in pain, sees his blackened skin. He yells to his comrades.\nVOLSTAGG (CONT'D)\nDon't let them grab hold of you! He takes a swig, enjoying the brief respite, then rejoins the battle.\nVolstagg stabs his blade in a Giant's chest, but the sword stops mid ice layer. The Giant delivers a bone-breaking blow to Volstagg's face, and the warrior drops to one knee. Sif sees Volstagg in trouble and rushes towards him. In one quick move, she leaps up and off of Volstagg's back, using her boot to plunge Volstagg's blade deep into the Giant's chest, standing atop him as he falls backwards to the ground.\nVOLSTAGG (CONT'D)\n(on his belly)\nThank you, my lady. But I nearly had him!\nSIF\nOf course you did. Nearby, a Frost Giant forms a BARRAGE OF ICE BULLETS, hurling them at Sif. Sif raises her shield barely in time, as the bullets go pinging and ricocheting off it. She races into the group of Frost Giants who attacked her and takes them out.\nA Frost Giant touches a pool of standing water. It FLASH- FREEZES Hogun's feet to the ground. Volstagg notices, hurries over, dispatching Jotuns as he goes.\nVOLSTAGG\nHang on!37."b"Volstagg swings his weapon, wildly hacking at the ice around \nHogun's legs to free him. Hogun looks down, suddenly worried, as Volstagg's blade cuts deep -- and perilously close to hacking into Hogun's legs.\nHOGUN\nWatch the legs!\nVOLSTAGG\n(REALIZING)\nRight. Sorry.\nVolstagg chips away at the ice more carefully, finally freeing Hogun's feet. Fandral sword fights with a Frost Giant.\nFANDRAL\nYou really think your icicles are a match for Asgardian steel? Fandral lunges at the Giant. The Jotun knocks his blade away.\nFANDRAL (CONT'D)\nFair enough.\nFandral moves on him again, but the Giant grabs Fandral's sword and snaps it in half.\nFANDRAL (CONT'D)\nCould we stop just a moment while I get another sword? Fandral fights the Giant with his broken sword. The Jotun then lunges at Fandral, who ducks just in time, grabs hold of the Giant's sword and redirects it, stabbing the Giant through with his own weapon. The Jotun staggers back, then reaches down and swipes at a pool of water, sending up a spray that freezes in mid-air, forming into an ICE STALAGMITE. It impales Fandral, rendering him helpless.\nLoki races towards the impaled Fandral, throwing daggers and felling Frost Giants as he goes. He reaches the nearly- unconscious warrior, when other Jotuns approach. He fights them off. Volstagg looks across the plaza and sees the impaled Fandral.\nVOLSTAGG\nThat's unfortunate. He hurries to his wounded comrade.38."b"FANDRAL\nI may need a bit of help. Not a \ngood look, is it?\nVOLSTAGG\nJust try not to bleed.\nFANDRAL\nHow's the face?\nVOLSTAGG\nFlawless.\nVolstagg begins to pull the bleeding Fandral off the ice stalagmite. Loki plunges two daggers into the chest of one of the Frost Giants. The Giant grabs hold of Loki's gloved wrists. Loki pulls his hands free of the gloves, which are still in the Giant's grasp, revealing Loki's skin beneath. The wounded Jotun sees his chance, grabs hold of Loki's bare arm. Loki looks at his arm, prepared for the worst. But instead of the blackness of necrotizing flesh, Loki's arm turns BLUE -- like the Frost Giant's own skin. The blueness spreads painlessly up Loki's arm. He stares at it, confused. The Frost Giant is thrown as well, distracted by the unexpected phenomenon. Loki takes advantage of the distraction, KICKS the Giant.\nThor continues fighting, his blood lust rising. He taunts \nthe Jotuns around him.\nTHOR\nCome on!\nBut when he hurls his hammer to take out a Jotun, the Frost Giants seize the opportunity. A group of Jotuns swarm Thor from all sides, keeping him separate from his weapon. Mjolnir falls to the ground. A Frost Giant desperately struggles to lift Mjolnir off the ground, to no avail. Now free, the wounded Fandral looks relieved as Volstagg slings him over his shoulder, and the warriors start to leave. From his balcony, Laufey looks upon the battlefield, decides it's time to pull out the big guns. He touches a wall of the palace. An ENERGY WAVE sweeps from his touch, across the wall of the palace, and down to the ground below. The Asgardians hear a foreboding CRACK OF ICE below their feet.\nLOKI\nThat can't be good.\nVOLSTAGG\nYes, it could! Might be an early spring!39."b"They look down, suddenly filled with dread when they see \nshadowy figures moving in the ice -- dozens of JOTUN WARRIORS awakening beneath the surface, rousing to join the battle. Loki turns to his brother, who battles a group of the Giants.\nLOKI\nThor, we must go! Thor, still without his hammer, fights his Jotun foes mercilessly, a man consumed by blood lust. Loki sees the look on his brother's face -- the savage thrill of the heat of battle.\nTHOR\nThen go!\nSIF\nThere are too many of them!\nTHOR\nI can stop them! The others hesitate. Jotuns break up through the ice all around them.\nSIF\nThor!\nBut Thor ignores his comrades, continues fighting.\nVOLSTAGG\nRun!\nReluctantly, the group flees back toward the inner edge of the planet as the Giants break up through the ice and give chase. Thor battles valiantly, but there's just too many of them. The Frost Giants swarm him from all sides now, as he disappears beneath a pile of blue flesh and ice. After a\nMOMENT --\nTHOR'S FIST\nForces its way up through the \nmiddle of the pile of Jotuns. He opens his hand, beckoning. One of Thor's attackers hears something ROARING up behind him. He whirls around -- BAM! -- Mjolnir nails him square in the face, then flies into Thor's outstretched hand. Thor raises the hammer up high, and brings it down on the ground with all his might. KRAKABOOM! \n(MORE)40."b"Lightning strikes down from the \nsky, the hammer channeling the blast, firing the electricity out at the Jotuns around him. They're blasted back in a massive shockwave. The Jotuns convulse, drop dead to the ground.\nBut the force of the blast also cracks the ice below, the shockwave continuing to spread outwards. It moves out to where his comrades are running, breaking up the ground beneath them, exposing the black void of space below.\nVOLSTAGG\nWhat's Thor done?\nLOKI\nLikely killed us all! As the Jotuns race towards the Asgardians, they open their mouths wide and breathe out an ICY FOG. The swirling mists quickly engulf the fleeing Asgardians before them. The Asgardians stand in the mist, unable to see. Hogun takes a step back, the ice cracking beneath him. They dare not move, for fear of falling through, into the void below. Thor sees he's put his friends in even greater danger. He raises Mjolnir high, SUMMONING THE WINDS. They lift him off the ground and carry him across the frozen wasteland to his comrades.\nEXT. BIFROST LANDING SITE (JOTUNHEIM) - DAY 35A 35A 35A\nThor lands beside his comrades in the shroud of mists.\nTHOR\nLoki, we have to see. Loki raises his arms, concentrates, the mists dissipating. But as they do, the Asgardians see before them the faces of the Frost Giants. And there are HUNDREDS of them -- too many, even for a Thunder God.\nVOLSTAGG\n(TO LOKI)\nActually, could you bring the mists back, please?THOR'S FIST (CONT'D)\n41."b"Thor realizes that he and his comrades are as good as dead. \nThe Giants move in for the kill, when they hear a deafening ROAR. A hole in the sky opens up, and the Bifrost blasts down onto the inner edge of the planet. Out of the maelstrom comes the sound of THUNDERING HOOVES, and, to the shock of all, tearing across the frozen wasteland comes --\nODIN ALLFATHER\nAstride his powerful, eight-legged steed SLEIPNIR. He's clad in battle armor, Gungnir in his hand -- an imposing sight.\nThe Giants part in fear as he thunders into their ranks, stopping before Laufey and the Asgardians. Laufey slams his fists into the ground, and the ice beneath his feet raises him towards Odin. The Asgardians start to react, thinking it's an attack, but Laufey just stands face- to-face with Odin. Asgardian and Jotun alike look on uneasily, unsure what's about to happen. Laufey sizes up Odin, notices that as powerful as the Allfather still is, the years have taken their toll. He's not the foe he once was. The two rulers talk quietly, out of earshot of the others.\nODIN\nLaufey. End this.\nLAUFEY\nYour boy sought this out.\nODIN\nYou're right. These are the actions of a boy. Treat them as such. You and I can stop this before there's further bloodshed. Unseen by Odin and the others, Laufey starts to form an ice blade at the end of his arm.\nLAUFEY\nWe are beyond diplomacy now, Allfather. He'll get what he came for -- war and death. Odin looks grim, determined.\nODIN\nSo be it.\nWithout warning, Laufey swings his ice blade at Odin, but Odin is quicker. The Allfather brings his spear down upon the ice. Laufey and the nearest Jotuns go falling backwards in a wave, the ice cracking beneath their feet. The other Frost Giants turn tail and run. Thor watches the fleeing Jotuns with delight.42."b"THOR\nNow! We'll finish them together!\nODIN\nSilence!\nOdin raises his spear. The hole in the sky opens, the \nBifrost energy blasting forth from it. The Bifrost envelops the Asgardians, yanks them off the ground and up through the hole. The vortex closes behind them as all falls silent. Laufey stares up after them contemptuously.\nINT. HEIMDALL'S OBSERVATORY - DAY 36 36 36\nHeimdall stands at the Observatory controls.

You have disobeyed the express command of your King. Through your arrogance and stupidity, you have opened these peaceful Realms and innocent lives to the horrors of war. The Allfather plunges Gungnir into Observatory's control panel. The turret turns, the Bifrost energy building along with Odin's rage. It FIRES, as the Bifrost opens at the end of the platform, creating a portal behind Thor. Odin turns angrily to his son.\nODIN (CONT'D)\nYou are unworthy of this Realm...

SMITH MOTORS - LAB - MORNING 45 45 45\nThe distant mountains glint snow in the early morning light. \nSelvig appears with a cup of coffee and surveys the vast desert. He turns back into the lab and sees Jane, busy at her workstation, soldering a piece of equipment. A printer churns out blown-up screen-cap PHOTOS of the Bifrost footage. Darcy hangs them on the wall. Selvig surveys the scene, watches how Jane works, impressed. He notices a monitor which displays a complex program entitled "J. FOSTER ALGORITHM ANALYSIS"\xc2\xac\xc3\xb9. He looks proud. The three of them have been up all night, fueled by caffeine and excitement.\nJANE\nDarcy, when you\'re done, take the soil samples to Professor Meyers in geology. Remind him, he owes me.\nSELVIG\nWe might want to perform a spectral analysis.\nJANE\n"We?"\xc2\xac\xc3\xb9\nSELVIG\nI flew all the way out here -- might as well make myself useful. This is the offer Jane\'s been waiting for. She gets up, inserts the piece of equipment she\'s been working on into a rack-mounted server.\nJANE\nYou know what would be really useful? Do you still have that friend at LIGO?\nSELVIG\nShe was more than a friend.\nJANE\nCould you call in a favor?\nSELVIG\nYou don\'t think this was just a magnetic storm?\nJANE\nIf I\'m right, their observatory must have picked up gravitational waves during last night\'s event.52.'b'SELVIG\nMeaning?\nJane heads over to a computer monitor. Selvig follows.\nJANE\nMeaning these anomalies might \nsignify something bigger.\nSELVIG\nHow "big"\xc2\xac\xc3\xb9 are we talking about? Jane indicates the footage on the monitor. As the last of the Bifrost cloud disappears into the night sky, there appears to be a blister in space, bulging out in convex and covered with stars.\nJANE\nI think the lensing around the edges is characteristic of an Einstein-Rosen Bridge.\nDARCY\nA what?\nSELVIG\nI thought you were a science major.\nDARCY\nPolitical Science. Selvig shoots Jane a confused look. Jane shrugs.\nJANE\nShe was the only applicant.\nSELVIG\n(TO DARCY)\nAn Einstein-Rosen Bridge -- a "theoretical"\xc2\xac\xc3\xb9 connection between two different points of space-time. Darcy stares blankly.\nJANE\n(TO DARCY)\nA wormhole.\nSelvig looks skeptical. Jane prints out a frame-grab off the monitor.\nJANE (CONT\'D)\nErik, look...53.'b'Jane indicates the print-out showing the constellations seen \nthrough the "bubble"\xc2\xac\xc3\xb9 in the clouds.\nJANE (CONT\'D)\nWhat do you see here?\nSELVIG\nStars.\nJANE\nYes. But not our stars. She spreads out a STAR CHART, barely able to contain her excitement.\nJANE (CONT\'D)\nThis is the star alignment for our quadrant, this time of year. So unless Ursa Minor decided to take the day off... those are someone else\'s constellations. Selvig\'s intrigued, in spite of himself. Darcy pulls another frame-grab of the Bifrost footage from the printer and hangs it on the wall, when something in the image catches her eye.\nDARCY\nHey, check it out. Jane and Selvig examine the photo, amazed.\nSELVIG\nIs that...?\nJANE\nI think I left something at the hospital.\nAs Jane walks away, we REVEAL the photo. Inside the Bifrost funnel cloud is a FIGURE -- the vague, but unmistakable shape of a MAN.\nEXT. ODIN\'S CHAMBERS - DAY 45A 45A 45A\nAt the top of the palace, we see a small FIGURE on the \nbalcony.

He's taken us to the brink of war!\nFRIGGA\nBut banishment? You would lose him forever? He's your son!\nODIN\nWhat would you have done?\nFRIGGA\nI would not have exiled him to a world of mortals, stripped of his powers, to suffer alone. I would not have had the heart for such cruelty!\nODIN\nThat is why I'm King.\n(THEN)\nI, too, grieve the loss of our son.

I don't know if finding him is the best idea.56."b"JANE\nI want to know what that thing was, \nand he may have the answers. We don't have a choice.\nDARCY\nOo-kay.\nShe pulls out her taser and a can of mace.\nSELVIG\nSo we're just going to spend the rest of the day looking for him?\nJANE\nHowever long it takes. Jane puts the car in reverse and backs up, when --\nBAM!\nShe collides with Thor again, dressed in stolen hospital \nscrubs. Jane and Selvig exchange a look.\nEXT.

HEALING ROOM - DAY 53 53 53\nSif, Loki, and the Warriors three, battered and shell- shocked, still reeling from the day's events, sit before a ROARING central fire. Hogun reaches into the flames, pulls out some fragile HEALING STONES. Neither the fire, nor the stones burn him. As he carefully places the stones over the wounds of his comrades, the stones begin to glow. 57."b"He crushes them to a powder. His comrades' injuries heal up \nat the glowing powder's touch. Fandral winces in pain as Hogun heals his gaping wound. Volstagg looks at the skin on his arm -- healing, but still blackened from the necrotizing touch of the Frost Giant. Loki watches him, then stares at his own arm, where the Giant's touch turned his skin blue. It's undamaged, back to its normal color.\nVOLSTAGG\nWe should never have let him go.\nSIF\nThere was no stopping him.\nFANDRAL\nAt least he's only banished, not dead. Which is what we'd all be if that guard hadn't told Odin where we'd gone.\nVOLSTAGG\nHow did the guard even know? Loki stares at his arm.\nLOKI\nI told him.\nFANDRAL\nWhat?\nLOKI\nI told him to go to Odin after we'd left. Though he should be flogged for taking so long.\nVOLSTAGG\nYou told the guard?\nLOKI\nI saved our lives! And Thor's. I had no idea Father would banish him for what he did.\nSIF\nLoki, you're the only one who can help Thor now. You must go to the Allfather and convince him to change his mind!\nLOKI\nAnd if I do, then what? I love Thor more dearly than any of you, but you know what he is. He's arrogant. He's reckless. He's dangerous. \n(MORE)58."b"You saw how he was today. Is that \nwhat Asgard needs from its King?\nThe others exchange glances, torn. Loki has a point. He leaves the room. Hogun stares after him.\nSIF\nHe may speak about the good of Asgard, but he's always been jealous of Thor.\nVOLSTAGG\nTrue, but we should be grateful to him. He did save our lives.\nHOGUN\nLaufey said there were traitors in the House of Odin. The others turn to the usually quiet Hogun.\nFANDRAL\nWhy is it every time you choose to speak, it has to be something dark and ominous?\nHOGUN\nA master of magic could easily bring three Jotuns into Asgard. The others look to Hogun, understanding the implication.\nVOLSTAGG\nNo! Surely not!\nFANDRAL\nLoki's always been one for mischief, but you're talking about something else entirely.\nSIF\nWho else could elude Heimdall's gaze with tricks of light and shadow?\nVOLSTAGG\nThe ceremony was interrupted just before Thor was named King.\nSIF\nWe should go to the Allfather.LOKI (CONT'D)\n59."b'FANDRAL\nAnd tell him what? "Oh, by the way, \nwe think your son just betrayed the throne. And do us a favor. Bring back Thor. There\'s a good fellow!"\xc2\xac\xc3\xb9\nSIF\nIt\'s our duty. If any of our suspicions are right, then all of Asgard is in danger.\nINT. VAULT - DAY 54 54 54\nLoki heads into the Vault, sees the Casket of Ancient Winters sitting on its stand. He walks over to it slowly, reaches out to it, lifts it between his forearms off its pedestal. As he does, a blueness spreads from his arms, across his body. The latticework behind the Casket starts to separate, the Destroyer rousing. A fire starts to glow within its black metal armor, as it rattles to life, but Loki ignores it -- the blueness spreading further, consuming his whole body.\nODIN (O.S.)\nStop!\nLoki turns, sees Odin hurrying into the room, the Destroyer goes motionless, the latticework rejoining before it. Odin eyes Loki with dismay.\nLOKI\nAm I cursed?\nODIN\nNo. Put the Casket down. Loki sets the Casket back upon its pedestal, his body quickly returning to its normal form and color. He stares at his father.\nLOKI\nWhat am I?\nODIN\nYou\'re my son.\nLOKI\nWhat more than that? Odin doesn\'t answer. He looks suddenly weary, burdened. Loki sizes him up, realizes the truth.60.'b"LOKI (CONT'D)\nThe Casket wasn't the only thing \nyou took from Jotunheim that day, was it?\nOdin looks him in the eye. He can deny it no longer.\nODIN\nNo.\n(BEAT)\nIn the aftermath of the battle, I went into the Temple, and I found a baby. Small for a giant's offspring -- abandoned, suffering, left to die. Laufey's son. Loki is sent reeling by the revelation.\nLOKI\nLaufey's son...\nHe desperately struggles to make sense of it all.\nLOKI (CONT'D)\nWhy? You were knee-deep in Jotun blood. Why would you take me?\nODIN\nYou were an innocent child.\nLOKI\nYou took me for a purpose, what was it?\nOdin doesn't answer.\nLOKI (CONT'D)\nTell me!\nODIN\nI thought we could unite our kingdoms one day, bring about an alliance, bring about a permanent peace... through you. But those plans no longer matter.\nLOKI\nSo I am no more than another stolen relic, locked up here until you might have use of me.\nODIN\nWhy do you twist my words?61."b'LOKI\nYou could have told me what I was \nfrom the beginning. Why didn\'t you?\nODIN\nYou are my son. My blood. I wanted only to protect you from the truth.\nLOKI\nBecause I am the monster parents tell their children about at night?\nODIN\nDon\'t...\nLOKI\nIt all makes sense now. Why you favored Thor all these years.\nODIN\nListen...\nLOKI\nBecause no matter how much you claim to "love"\xc2\xac\xc3\xb9 me, you could never have a Frost Giant sitting on the Throne of Asgard! Odin\'s body begins to shake, he lifts his hand. It starts to move out of synch temporarily, leaving a trail, the effect of the Odinsleep approaching. Loki doesn\'t notice as Odin tries to fight it off.\nODIN\nListen to me!\nLoki strides away towards the exit.\nODIN (CONT\'D)\nLoki!\nOdin starts towards him, when the enormous mental, emotional, and physical strain of recent events finally takes its toll. The effect of the Odinsleep consumes him. His entire body now moves out of sync with the rest of the world, leaving trails behind him as he staggers backwards. Odin falls back against a wall, his face contorting in a scream. He collapses to the stone floor. Loki, shocked, hurries to him. He takes Odin in his arms, calls out.\nLOKI\nGuards!62.'b'OMITTED 55 55 55\nOMITTED 56 56 56\nOMITTED MERGED WITH SCENE 54 57 57 57\nEXT.

INSIDE OF CRATER 59 59 59\nIt looks like the whole town has turned out. LOCALS sit on \nlounge chairs, drink beer from coolers, laugh and talk. They watch the center of the crater, where LARGE MEN have formed a line to take a turn with the mysterious object. One of them struggles and fails to lift it. As he gives up, the next man steps up and takes his turn, straining from the effort. Other Townies SNAP PICTURES of the scene with their cell phones. They hear an approaching RUMBLE, then clear a path as a large PICK-UP TRUCK backs its way down the crater\'s edge. An EAGER TOWNIE hops out the passenger side and pulls a thick chain from the back of the truck. He fastens one end around the object, then securely affixes the chain to the bumper and the rear of the undercarriage.\nEAGER TOWNIE\nThis\'ll do it.\nHe yells to the driver.\nEAGER TOWNIE (CONT\'D)\nOkay, let \'er rip!

They don\'t notice as --\nON THE CRATER\'S EDGE ABOVE THEMAn imposing GOVERNMENT VEHICLE pulls up to a stop. A Fed in \na suit climbs out, peers down at the boisterous gathering below, his eyes fixed on the object at the center of the crater. He is SHIELD AGENT COULSON. He stares down at the object which glows with an otherworldly blue energy -- MJOLNIR. He pulls out a phone.63.'b'COULSON\n(INTO PHONE)\nSir -- we\'ve found it.\nINT. SMITH MOTORS - LAB - DAY 60 60 60\nIn a back room, Thor, now shirtless and wearing jeans, looks \naround for a t-shirt. Jane and Darcy, standing in the lab, can\'t help but notice his reflection in the mirror. Darcy eyes his powerful build, rippling biceps.\nDARCY\nYou know, for a crazy homeless guy, he\'s pretty cut. Jane turns away. Thor emerges from the back room, holding a t-shirt.\nDARCY (CONT\'D)\nHey, sorry I tased you! Thor heads over to Jane\'s work area, starts fiddling with the equipment there with interest. Jane hurries over to put a stop to it.\nJANE\nExcuse me... excuse me! She leads him away from the work station. Thor holds up the t-shirt. On the front, it bear a sticker which reads: "HELLO, MY NAME IS DR. DONALD BLAKE"\xc2\xac\xc3\xb9. Thor looks at it, puzzled. Jane rips the sticker off.\nJANE (CONT\'D)\nMy ex.\nThor stares at her a beat.\nJANE (CONT\'D)\nThey\'re the only clothes I had that\'ll fit you. Sorry.\nTHOR\nThey will suffice.

Jane points to his form in the Bifrost photo.64.'b"JANE (CONT'D)\nWhat were you doing, in that? He \nglances at it, dismissive.\nTHOR\nWhat does anyone do in the Bifrost? Everyone stares at him. Selvig seems to recognize the word. Jane opens her notebook, quickly writes the word down. Thor moves close to her, eyes the notations and drawings within the book, curious.\nSELVIG\n(amused, skeptical)\nThe Bifrost...\nJane starts to get uncomfortable with Thor standing so close to her, looking over her notations. She quickly closes the book.\nJANE\nWhat exactly is the Bifrost?\nTHOR\n(IGNORING HER)\nThis mortal form has grown weak.\nJANE\nBUT--\nJANE (CONT'D)\nSomebody get the mortal a Pop-Tart.\nINT. ODIN'S CHAMBERS - DAY 61 61 61\nFrigga sits at her husband's bedside, holding his hand. Odin lies there -- looking pale and lifeless, his body and the space around it warped from the effect of the Odinsleep. The walls of the chamber have moved close around him, protecting him like a dark crypt, sealing off any daylight. Loki sits at Odin's side, across from Frigga. She speaks softly to him.\nFRIGGA\nI asked him to be honest with you from the beginning. There should be no secrets in a family.\nLOKI\nSo why did he lie?65."b"FRIGGA\nHe kept the truth from you so that \nyou would never feel different. You are in every way our son, Loki, and we your family. You must know that.\nLoki takes this in, stares at Odin.\nFRIGGA (CONT'D)\n(RE: ODIN)\nYou can speak to him. He can see and hear us, even now.\nLOKI\nHow long will it last?\nFRIGGA\nI don't know. This time is different. We were unprepared.\nLOKI\nI never get used to seeing him like this. The most powerful being in the Nine Realms lying helpless until his body is restored.\nFRIGGA\nBut he's put it off for so long now, I fear...\nLoki takes her hand. She's grateful, wipes tears from her eyes.\nFRIGGA (CONT'D)\nYou're a good son.

Loki tenses, prepared for \nthe worst, but the guards just stand before them. Loki is baffled.\nFRIGGA\nThor is banished. The line of succession falls to you. Until he awakens, Asgard is yours.\nThe Einherjar kneel before the shocked Loki. Another EINHERJAR enters, holding Gungnir before him. He kneels before Loki, offers the spear to him.\nFRIGGA (CONT'D)\nMake your father proud. Loki reaches out tentatively, then takes it. He likes the feel of it in his hand.\nINT. ISABELA'S DINER - MORNING 62 62 62\nThor, Selvig, Darcy, and Jane sit at a table in the local diner. Selvig and Darcy watch as Thor eats ravenously from a huge mound of steak and eggs.

But it was heavy. \nReal heavy. Nobody could lift it. This gets Thor's attention.\nThor springs to his feet, heads over to Drunk Townie Jake, \nand pulls the Townie around to face him.\nTHOR\nWhere?!\nDRUNK TOWNIE JAKE\nAbout twelve miles east of here.

He looks to see an ATV moving across the site, shining its spotlight right on him. Thor sees that the ATV DRIVER has spotted him. The Driver raises his radio to report. Thor knows he has to act fact. He raises the rifle -- then flips it over in the air and catches it by the barrel. He rears the weapon back, then hurls it like a hammer. It flies through the air, smashing the ATV's spotlight.

I mean, a big, faceless organization like yours, coming in with their jack-booted thugs and stealing private property...\n(THEN)\n...is how he described it.\nCOULSON\nThat doesn\'t explain how he managed to tear through our security. Selvig shrugs.\nSELVIG\nSteroids. He\'s a bit of a fitness nut.\nOn the Techie\'s monitor, a DMV record from the State of New York pops up reading "DR. DONALD BLAKE"\xc2\xac\xc3\xb9. The license photo is indeed a picture of Thor -- the one Darcy took with her cellphone.\nThe Techie hits a button, and a graphic reads, "SHIELD \nSECURITY ANALYSIS IN PROGRESS."\xc2\xac\xc3\xb9 Coulson eyes the screen. After a beat, he turns back to Selvig.\nCOULSON\nIt says here he\'s an M.D.\nSELVIG\nHe is. That is, he was. He switched careers and became a physicist. He\'s quite brilliant, really.96.'b"(THEN)\nIf you would just release him to \nme, I promise to keep an eye on him.\nCoulson thinks, sizing Selvig up -- then smiles. He turns to an AGENT nearby.\nCOULSON\nRelease Dr. Blake to Dr. Selvig here.\nThe Techie looks to him, surprised.\nCOULSON (CONT'D)\n(TO SELVIG)\nMake sure he stays in town for the next few days in case we need to talk to him again. Selvig shakes his hand.\nSELVIG\nThank you.\nINT. SHIELD HOLDING CELL - NIGHT 92A 92A 92A\nSelvig bursts into the room with a SHIELD Agent to find a seated Thor.\nSELVIG\nDonny, Donny, Donny! There you are!\nThor looks up, unsure what the hell is going on. Selvig pulls Thor to his feet, gives him a warm hug.\nSELVIG (CONT'D)\nIt's going to be all right, my friend. Come on, I'm taking you home.\nHe leads the bewildered Thor out the door.\nEXT. COULSON'S TRAILER - NIGHT 92B 92B 92B\nAs Thor and Selvig make their way past the SHIELD Security \nRoom, Thor notices Jane's possessions and equipment from the Smith Motors lab stacked under a tarp.

SECURITY ROOM - NIGHT 92C 92C 92C\nCoulson looks at the computer bearing Donald Blake's DMV \nrecord. 97."b'A security warning over the image clearly reads "SECURITY \nALERT: FALSIFIED DATA."\xc2\xac\xc3\xb9 He knows it\'s been a ruse all along. He looks to Selvig and Thor heading away from the Security Room, then follows them outside.\nEXT. SHIELD DESERT BASE - NIGHT 93 93 93\nCoulson and two SHIELD Agents watch as Selvig walks with \nThor away from the base to the SUV. Coulson calls to Selvig.\nCOULSON\nJust keep him away from the bars.\nSELVIG\nI will!\nTHOR\n(TO SELVIG)\nWhere are we going? Selvig drops his cool demeanor.\nSELVIG\nTo get a drink.\nSelvig and Thor climb into the SUV. As they drive off, Coulson turns to the other two agents -- GARRETT and CALE.\nCOULSON\nFollow them.\nEXT. JOTUNHEIM - DAY 94 94 94\nLoki, looking apprehensive, walks alone across the icy surface of the planet.\nINT. LAUFEY\'S TEMPLE - DAY 95 95 95\nDarkness shrouds the ruined temple, save for the shafts of \nlight which knife their way in through the damaged ceiling. Loki enters. Frost Giant guards surround him on all sides. Laufey approaches, towers over him menacingly.\nLAUFEY\nTell me why I shouldn\'t kill you.\nLOKI\nI\'ve come alone and unarmed.\nLAUFEY\nTo what end?\nLOKI\nTo make you another proposition.98.'b"LAUFEY\n(REALIZING)\nSo you're the one who let us into \nAsgard.\nLOKI\nYou're welcome.\nLAUFEY\nMy men are dead, and I have no Casket. You are a deceiver. Laufey lashes out, grabs Loki around the throat, but Loki calmly stands his ground.\nLOKI\nYou have no idea what I am. The blueness spreads across his face, as Laufey and the guards stare in shock. Loki grins.\nLOKI (CONT'D)\nHello, Father.\nLaufey releases him. Loki's body turns back to normal. Intrigued, Laufey sizes up his son.\nLAUFEY\nAh, the bastard son. I thought Odin had killed you. That's what I would have done. He's as weak as you are.\nLOKI\nNo longer weak. I now rule Asgard, until Odin awakens. Perhaps you should not have so carelessly abandoned me.\nThis gives Laufey pause.\nLAUFEY\nOr perhaps it was the wisest choice I've ever made. I will hear you.\nLOKI\nI will conceal you and a handful of your soldiers, lead you into his chambers, and let you slay him where he lies. I'll keep the throne, and you will have the Casket.\nLaufey studies Loki's face.99."b"LAUFEY\nWhy would you do this?\nLOKI\nWhen all is done, we will have a \npermanent peace between our two worlds. Then I, the bastard son, will have accomplished what Odin and Thor never could.\nLAUFEY\nThis is a great day for Jotunheim. Asgard is finally ours.\nLOKI\nNo. Asgard is mine. The rest of the Nine Realms will be yours, if you do as you're told. Laufey considers the proposition.\nLAUFEY\nI accept.\nLoki turns to leave. As he goes, the slightest trace of a smile crosses his face.\nINT. HEIMDALL'S OBSERVATORY - DAY 96 96 96\nLoki emerges out of the Bifrost, as Heimdall steps away from \nhis controls. Heimdall glares at Loki. Loki notices.\nLOKI\nWhat troubles you, Gatekeeper?\nHEIMDALL\nI turned my gaze upon you in Jotunheim, but could neither see nor hear you. You were shrouded from me, like the Frost Giants who entered this Realm.\nLOKI\nPerhaps your senses have weakened after your many years of service.\nHEIMDALL\nOr perhaps someone has found a way to hide that which he does not wish me to see.\nLoki sizes him up, smiles.100."b"LOKI\nYou have great power, Heimdall. \nTell me, did Odin ever fear you?\nHEIMDALL\nNo.\nLOKI\nAnd why is that?\nHEIMDALL\nBecause he is my King, and I am sworn to obey him.\nLOKI\nExactly. Just as you're sworn to obey me now. Yes? A beat.\nHEIMDALL\nYes.\nLOKI\nGood. Then you will open the Bifrost to no one until I have undone what my brother has started. Loki heads out of the Observatory. Heimdall stares after him.\nINT. BAR - NIGHT 97 97 97\nThor and Selvig sit at a booth at the back of the local dive. The bartender sets down a couple mugs of beer and two shots of whiskey. Selvig pours the shot into his mug and downs it. Thor follows his example.\nSELVIG\nSeems Darcy's a terrible intern, but a talented hacker.\nTHOR\nThank you for what you've done.\nSELVIG\nDon't thank me. I only did it for Jane.\nTHOR\nAre you in love with her?\nSELVIG\nOf course not! Jane's like a daughter to me. Her father and I taught at University together. \n(MORE)101."b"A good man, but he never listened. \nThis registers with Thor.\nTHOR\nNeither did I.\nSelvig eyes him with interest.\nSELVIG\nI don't know if you're really delusional, and I really don't care at this point. I just care about her. I've seen the way she looks at you.\nTHOR\nI swear to you, I mean her no harm.\nSELVIG\nGood. If that's the case, then I'll buy you one more drink, and you'll leave town tonight. A long pause, then Thor nods. He takes a drink.\nTHOR\nI had it all backwards. I had it all wrong.\nSelvig watches him keenly. This is a different Thor than he's seen before.\nSELVIG\nIt's not a bad thing, finding out that you don't have all the answers. That's when you start asking the right questions. Thor takes this in.\nTHOR\nFor the first time in my life, I have no idea what I'm supposed to do.\nSELVIG\nAnyone who's ever going to find their way in this world has to start by admitting they don't know where the hell they are. Thor nods.\nDRUNK TOWNIE (O.S.)\nHey, I know you, man... An intimidating DRUNK TOWNIE nearby sizes up Thor. SELVIG (CONT'D)\n(MORE)102."b"He is one of the Townies from \nIsabela's Diner who saw Thor earlier. He approaches, belligerent and looking for a fight.\nDRUNK TOWNIE (CONT'D)\nYou were in the diner with that hot girl.\nThor doesn't like where this is going.\nDRUNK TOWNIE (CONT'D)\nI wouldn't mind her doing a little research on me.\nHe laughs. Thor is annoyed.\nTHOR\nI have no quarrel with you. But she's a lady. You should be more respectful.\nDRUNK TOWNIE\nAnd you should shut the hell up, princess.\nSelvig looks to Thor, concerned that he's going to lose it. But, to his surprise, Thor remains unaffected by the Townie's baiting.\nTHOR\nI will not fight him.\nDRUNK TOWNIE\nThen it'll be easy to kick your ass.\nSelvig stands, steps between the two men.\nSELVIG\nGentlemen, please. Let's keep our heads.\nJust then, Selvig HEAD-BUTTS the Townie, knocking him out. Thor's impressed. Selvig downs his drink, then hurls his glass aside, SHATTERING it on the ground.\nSELVIG (CONT'D)\n(TO THOR)\nAnother drink?DRUNK TOWNIE (O.S.) (CONT'D)\n103."b'EXT. MAIN STREET - NIGHT 98 98 98\nThor and Selvig stumble down the street, singing a NORWEGIAN \nFOLK SONG. They improvise an impromptu drinking song dance routine involving side steps and happy slaps, optimistically in time with the song.\nTHOR/SELVIG\n(SINGING)\n"The mood is good, our hearts are \nfull, there\'s magic in the air. / It\'s all because we\'re here tonight, and haven\'t got a care. / So raise a glass, and toast to life, wherever it may lead / Tra-la- la, tra-la-la, a friend is fine indeed. / Tra-la-la, tra-la-la, a friend is fine indeed!"\xc2\xac\xc3\xb9 Thor holds up a hand for Selvig\'s last finishing slap. Selvig misses it completely and falls out of frame like a straight dead weight with a CLUNK. WIDE SHOT. Emerging from behind the car where Selvig fell, Thor stands up, Selvig slung over his shoulder, and starts to walk up the street towards Jane\'s trailer.\nINT. JANE\'S TRAILER - NIGHT 99 99 99\nThe small trailer is in a state of perpetual disarray, strewn with various books, old pizza boxes, etc. A worried Jane lies on her bed, trying to read. She\'s startled by the loud RAPPING on the door. She bolts to the door and opens it to find --\nTHOR\nStanding there with the unconscious Selvig slung over his shoulder.\nJANE\nErik!\n(TO THOR)\nIs he all right?\nTHOR\nHe\'s fine. Not injured at all.\nAs Thor enters, he BANGS Selvig\'s head on the doorway. Selvig GROANS.104.'b"THOR (CONT'D)\nSorry, my friend.\nJANE\nWhat happened?\nTHOR\nWe drank. We fought. He made his \nancestors proud.\nJANE\nPut him on the bed. Thor moves through the small trailer carrying Selvig, like a bear lugging another bear, smashing into things along the way, until he finally sets Selvig down on Jane's bed. Selvig awakens groggily and looks up at him through bleary eyes.\nSELVIG\nI still don't believe you're the God of Thunder.\n(THEN)\nBut you ought to be. Thor grins, pats him on the cheek. As Selvig drifts off to sleep, Thor pulls a blanket over him. Jane watches, stunned by their friendship, impressed by Thor's tenderness. Thor turns back to her, looks around.\nTHOR\nThese are your chambers? Jane suddenly becomes self-conscious. She starts cleaning up the mess around her.\nJANE\nWell, it's more of a temporary living space, really. I don't usually have visitors in here. Actually, never... Thor picks up a sock off the floor. She snatches it from him, puts it away.\nJANE (CONT'D)\nCan we go outside?105."b"EXT. SMITH MOTORS - ROOF - NIGHT 100 100 100\nThor steps off a ladder onto the roof of Smith Motors. He \noffers Jane his hand, helps her up. There's a telescope set up, a couple chairs, some blankets.\nJANE\nI come up here sometimes when I can't sleep. Or when I'm trying to reconcile particle data. Or when Darcy's driving me crazy.\n(THEN)\nI come up here a lot, now that I think about it.\nThor looks at the night sky, filled with stars.\nJANE\nI'm glad you're safe.\nTHOR\nYou've been very kind. I've been far less grateful than you deserve.\nJANE\nI also hit you with my car a couple times, so it kind of evens out. He grins, then reaches into his pocket and pulls out her\nNOTEBOOK.\nJANE\nI don't believe it... She takes it from him, surprised and grateful.\nTHOR\nIt was all I could get back. Not as much as I promised. I'm sorry.\nJANE\nNo, this is good. Thank you. This means I don't have to start from scratch...\nShe sits down and opens the notebook eagerly, then stops, a harsh realization clouding her face. Thor notices.\nTHOR\nWhat's wrong?106."b"JANE\nSHIELD, whatever they are. They're \nnever going to let this research see the light of day.\nTHOR\nYou must do this. You must finish what you've started.\nJANE\nWhy?\nTHOR\nBecause you're right. It's taken so many generations for your people to get to this point. You're nearly there. You just need someone to show you how close you really are.\nThor moves beside her, opens her notebook, turns to the page which bears a sketch of the Bifrost. He takes the pen from the notebook, begins to add to the sketch, leading from one point to another in space.\nTHOR (CONT'D)\nLook -- your ancestors called it magic. You call it science. I come from a place where they're one and the same thing. We recognize that Thor is drawing the branches of Yggdrasil as she looks on, amazed and intrigued.\nJANE\nWhat is it?\nTHOR\nThis is how my father explained it to me...\n(THEN)\nYour world is one of the Nine Realms of the Cosmos, linked to each other by the branches of Yggdrasil, the Worlds Tree. Now, you see it every day, without realizing. Images glimpsed through -- what did you call it?...\n(checks her notebook)\n...this Hubble Telescope. So, Nine Realms...\nThey look at each other. She nods. They smile. This is going to be a long night.107."b"EXT. SMITH MOTORS - ROOF - LATER 101 101 101\nJane sleeps beside Thor on the blankets on the rooftop. He \nstares up at the night sky.

HEALING ROOM - DAY 102 102 102\nVolstagg eats ravenously from a PLATTER OF FOOD. Sif stands \nnearby, ill at ease. Fandral watches Volstagg incredulously as the large warrior stuffs himself. Finally Fandral can stand it no more.\nFANDRAL\nOur dearest friend banished, Loki on the throne, Asgard on the brink of war, yet you manage to consume four wild boar, six pheasant, a side of beef, and two casks of ale. Shame on you! Don't you care?! Fandral moves to throw the platter in the fire, but Volstagg pulls his weapon, stopping him.\nVOLSTAGG\nDo not mistake my appetite for apathy.\nSIF\nStop it, both of you! We all know what we have to do, we're just too damned afraid to do it!\nHOGUN\n(DECIDES)\nWe must go. We must find Thor. Hogun starts to pull the delicate HEALING STONES from the fire, carefully putting them into a POUCH at his side.\nFANDRAL\nIt's treason, Hogun.\nVOLSTAGG\nTo hell with treason, it's suicide.\n(SUDDENLY NERVOUS)\nNow, shh! Heimdall may be watching! It's said he can hear--\nFANDRAL\nYes, yes, we know!108."b"SIF\nThor would do the same for us. An \nEINHERJAR GUARD enters.

HEIMDALL\'S OBSERVATORY - DAY 109 109 109\nSif and the Warriors Three enter warily to find the intimidating Heimdall standing before the Observatory\'s controls. He glares at them accusingly.\nVOLSTAGG\nGood Heimdall, less us explain--\nHEIMDALL\nYou would defy the commands of Loki our King, break every oath you have taken as warriors, and commit treason to bring Thor back? The four exchange nervous glances.\nSIF\nYes, but--\nHEIMDALL\nGood.\nThe group looks puzzled. What did he just say?\nVOLSTAGG\nSo you\'ll help us?\nHEIMDALL\nI am bound by honor to our King.

BIFROST LANDING SITE (EARTH) - DAY 111 111 111\nAmidst the fury of the Bifrost storm, the Warriors Three and Sif drop to the ground in the New Mexico desert. They clamber to their feet as the Bifrost quickly recedes, the hole in the sky closing up behind it. The Bifrost runes cover the desert sand around them.\nVOLSTAGG\nHe must have landed nearby. It's time to put our tracking skills to work. Spread out. Check the sand for indentations of his boot prints.HEIMDALL (CONT'D)\n112."b"FANDRAL\nThe winds would have blown them \naway by now. We should look for signs of a campfire.\nSIF\nOr we could just start there. She points behind them to the town of Puente Antiguo in the distance -- the only visible sign of civilization -- and to Hogun, who has already started walking towards it. Volstagg and Fandral trade looks, their egos bruised.\nFANDRAL\nIt's worth a look, I suppose. The party tromps towards the town.\nEXT.

He \nhands the ball back to the boy, tousling his hair.\nVOLSTAGG\nThere you go, lad! The boy just stares, standing frozen.

Loki reaches out and, with both hands, takes hold of something invisible, hovering in mid-air before him. As it quickly fades into view, we realize what it is --\nTHE CASKET OF ANCIENT WINTERS.\nThe blueness creeps from his hands and up his arms, as Loki \nopens the Casket towards Heimdall, who is fast approaching. From inside the Casket, all hell breaks loose. The fury of the Casket is unleashed, its winds not just howling, but SCREAMING, as ice and snow and darkness come flying straight towards Heimdall. Ice clings to his body, freezing him, but still he moves forward. Loki starts to get worried. Heimdall is nearly upon him. The Gatekeeper swings his massive sword at the prince. But the blade STOPS, frozen, just inches from Loki's throat. Loki breathes a sigh of relief and steps past him.\nINT.

It looks like it might actually work for a moment, but the Destroyer stays on its feet. It lifts Volstagg into the by the scruff of his neck. He shrugs apologetically. The Destroyer savagely HURLS him at Hogun and Fandral, smashing into them, when --\nSIF\nLeaps off a nearby rooftop with her two-headed spear and plunges it deep into the back of the creature. The creature stands there motionless, the fire dimming in its faceplate, Sif standing atop its back. The Asgardians have a brief moment of hope. But the creature stirs with life, its fire igniting once again. Sif looks on with growing trepidation. Slowly, unnaturally, the Destroyer spins its torso around 180 degrees to face its attackers. The Destroyer unleashes a blast at Sif. She barely dives off of the behemoth in time, dodging the blast. The Destroyer rises again to its full height, pulling free from Sif's staff, the weapon slipping through the slats of its armor. Sif and the Warriors Three try to regroup, when the Destroyer unleashes another blast, sending Sif and her comrades flying in all directions. Hogun's POUCH OF HEALING STONES breaks free, landing in the middle of the street.\nEXT. SMITH MOTORS - DAY 131 131 131\nThor sees his friends lying injured on the ground, but has no time to act, as the Destroyer fires in his direction. A storefront near Smith Motor EXPLODES, knocking Thor, Jane, and Selvig off their feet. Thor helps Jane to her feet, when they notice Selvig lying on his back amidst the debris, impaled by a twisted piece of iron.\nJANE\nErik!\nShe and Thor hurry to his side. He's losing blood, going into shock.121."b"SELVIG\n(TO JANE)\nGo! Leave me!\nJane takes his hand as Thor spots Hogun's pouch of healing \nstones lying in the middle of the street. He makes a break for it, dodging through the flaming wreckage, then grabs the pouch and races back. He opens the pouch to find the fragile stones crushed and useless. He pours the contents out in his hand.\nTHOR\nCome on... give me one! Amidst the useless powder, he finally finds one stone still intact. Thor tosses the pouch aside, holds the stone over the end of the iron rod.\nJANE\nWhat are you doing? What is that? As the stone begins to glow, Thor crushes it. Jane looks on, amazed, as the glowing powder falls upon the piece of iron, dissolving it, heading downwards, until it reaches Selvig's wound. The powder heals his wound completely.\nThor looks down the street, sees his wounded friends still lying there, as Selvig sits up in utter astonishment. He reaches through the hole in his shirt to touch his healed flesh.\nSELVIG\n(to Jane, re: Thor)\nI'm really starting to like him. Jane turns to Thor to find he's gone.\nEXT. DOWN THE STREET 132 132 132\nThor reaches Sif, who lies dazed, battered, and bloodied on the ground.

I will die a warrior's death. \nStories will be told of this day-- He gently takes her shield from her.\nTHOR\nLive and tell those stories yourself.\nAt last, she nods. Thor spots Volstagg lying unconscious, with Hogun and Fandral lying nearby. Thor makes his way towards them. Volstagg is barely breathing. Thor tries to pull him to safety, but it's no use. He won't budge. He rouses Hogun and Fandral.\nTHOR (CONT'D)\n(RE: VOLSTAGG)\nGet him out of here!\nFANDRAL\nNo. We can still fight!\nTHOR\nBut not win. Move Volstagg, or he'll die!\nThor looks at them, grins.\nTHOR (CONT'D)\nDon't worry, my friends. I have a plan.\nThe two Warriors reluctantly grab their fallen friend and drag him away from the battlefield. After they go, Thor turns to back to the Destroyer, then tosses Sif's shield aside. He strides down the street towards the behemoth, completely defenseless.\nTHOR (CONT'D)\nBrother... for whatever I have done to wrong you, whatever I have done to lead you to do this, I am sorry. But these people have done nothing to you. They are innocents. He continues towards the Destroyer.\nTHOR (CONT'D)\nTake my life, and know I will never return to Asgard.123."b"Thor reaches the Destroyer, extends his arms. The Destroyer \nhesitates, sizing up the defenseless Thor, then swats him with its enormous arm. We hear the sickening CRACK of breaking bones as Thor goes flying. Thor lands in a crumpled, broken heap in front of Smith Motors, before Jane, Selvig, and Darcy. The wounded Asgardians watch helplessly from down the street, a look of horror on their faces. Jane tries to rush out to Thor's aid, but Selvig holds her back.\nSELVIG\nJane, no!\nHe pulls her into Smith Motors. A RAVEN flies overhead, watching the scene --\nINT.

Electricity starts to CRACKLE on the hammer's surface. SCIENTISTS beside it take notice as it vibrates, and a RUMBLE comes from overhead. They look up. Clouds form in the sky above. Just then, with a CRACK and flash of lightning, Mjolnir flies straight up into the air like a rocket.\nEXT. MAIN STREET 136 136 136\nThe Destroyer unleashes its blast at Thor's body, when --KRAKAKABOOM!A blinding BOLT OF LIGHTNING strikes down from above, \ncolliding with the Destroyer's blast.

Thor kneels, brings Mjolnir down onto the ground.\nKRAKABOOM!Lightning strikes the Destroyer. It convulses. Thor swings \nMjolnir around, takes off straight up into the air, as the Destroyer gets back on its feet and looks up at the Thunder God. Storm clouds gather around Thor as he summons gale force winds. Debris from the battle begins to rise up into the sky. The Destroyer stays there, kept grounded by its massive weight.\nIt lifts its head up at the Thunder God, opens its \nfaceplate, locks it in place, unleashes its blast. Thor dives downwards straight at it, with Mjolnir before him. Mjolnir collides with the Destroyer's fiery energy blast, overpowering it, pushing it back, forcing it downwards at the Destroyer. Thor jams his hammer deep into the Destroyer's faceplate. The fiery energy within the creature builds up and EXPLODES within him, firing out of all his openings. Thor smashes the Destroyer to the ground in a tremendous heap, the fiery energy within it extinguished forever. Thor pulls Mjolnir from its faceplate, walks away from its lifeless carcass. As he does, the other objects and debris pulled into the air by the gale winds drop down from the skies, around the Destroyer, burying it. Jane and Thor's comrades, now roused, stand to join him. A battered Coulson approaches with several SHIELD AGENTS.\nCOULSON\nDonald... I don't think you've been completely honest with me.\nEXT.

Thor catches it in his \nhand, rears back his hammer as if ready to return the blow, but instead takes to the air and flies past Loki, back towards the frozen controls.

The hammer flies into the Bifrost towards Jotunheim. Thor raises his hand towards his hammer, tries to summon it back to him, to keep it in this Realm, but the Bifrost is too powerful. Mjolnir disappears into the maelstrom as Thor himself slides towards the Bifrost.\nLOKI\nIf you care so much for the Jotuns, then die with them. The Bifrost stretches every cell of Thor's body, trying to drag him away. He's nearly swallowed by the vortex, when he concentrates, mustering his will. He reaches out his hand towards the Bifrost.

Loki lifts Thor into the air, impaled on the spear, and hurls him across the bridge.\nThor, bleeding, rises to his knees. Loki strides up behind \nhim to finish him off, when Thor swing his hammer around. It passes through him. Instantly, another Loki appears next to him, Thor swings his hammer, but that too is an illusion. Loki after Loki appears, Thor futilely swinging at each one, never making contact. Thor falls back to his knees. The Lokis grin as their raises their spears, encircling him.\nLOKIS\nI was always more clever than you.\nTHOR\nYet still not clever enough. With that, Thor raises his hammer, rising into the air, summoning lightning. A massive bolt strikes Mjolnir, then channels outwards, splitting up, striking each one of the Lokis.\nAll of them dissipate into nothingness, save one -- the real Loki -- who's sent flying back across the Bridge, Gungnir knocked from his grasp. Thor steps over to his fallen brother, lying dazed on his back. Loki winces, prepares for the worst, when Thor steps away. Loki opens his eyes, tries to stand, but can't. He looks confused, then sees what the problem is -- Mjolnir rests atop his chest. Struggle as he may, Loki can't lift it off. He's pinned to the ground. Thor looks about him desperately -- at the Bifrost firing towards Jotunheim, gaining in strength, at the surge of energy moving through the Bridge. He's at a loss of what to do. Loki watches him smugly.\nLOKI\nLook at you, the Mighty Thor. With all your strength, what good does it do you now? Thor knows Loki's right.

Loki looks confused.\nThor raises Mjolnir in the air. Clouds form above him, thunder RUMBLING. Lightning arcs off of his hammer, as he channels the power of the storm into it, then -- He strikes Mjolnir down upon the Rainbow Bridge. The blow is massive, causing a rumbling along the whole bridge, shaking the Observatory itself like an earthquake. A crack appears where the blow struck. Loki rises to his feet.\nLOKI (CONT'D)\nStop!

Loki thinks fast.\nLOKI (CONT'D)\nIf you destroy the Bridge, you'll never see her again! Loki grabs Gungnir, runs towards him, ready to pierce Thor through the back.\nTHOR\nForgive me.\nSummoning every bit of strength he has left, Thor raises Mjolnir one last time, drawing lightning to it from all sides, and brings it down with a final, terrible blow -- KRAKABOOM! The Bifrost SHATTERS, rainbow energy EXPLODING out of it. Both Loki and Thor are hurled into the air by the force of the blast. A wave of destruction moves forward along the Bridge towards the Observatory, breaking it apart as it goes. The Observatory RIPS ITSELF APART. As Loki and Thor fall together, Thor grabs hold of one end of Gungnir, while Loki still clutches the other. They both fall towards the MASSIVE WAVE of Bifrost energy which spews out from the broken Bridge.

The forms which stand in closest competition with those undergoing modification and improvement will naturally suffer most.\xe2\x80\x9d-Charles Darwin, "Origin of the Species"'b'FADE IN: EXT. MOSCOW - FUTURE - DAY11*We soar over the skyline. Buildings have been destroyed. Windows shattered. Streets deserted. We land on--EXT. RED SQUARE - FUTURE - DAY22MILITARY TRUCKS roll into the middle of the square. Empty, ghostly. Pigeons flap, the only signs of life. SUPER: The not too distant future...SOLDIERS climb out of the trucks. They have insignias on their uniforms, an icon that will become familiar.  They open the back doors of a truck. We PUSH INTO THE BACK. *Dark, quiet. Shadows shift, and we hear-- A MECHANICAL HUM coming to life. As it rises, we CUT TO--EXT. KREMLIN PALACE - FUTURE - DAY33This sprawling site was once the center of a superpower. Now it is abandoned. We push toward it, and--DROP DOWN DOWN DOWN A HUNDRED FEET UNDERGROUND TO--INT. KREMLIN PALACE - UNDERGROUND HALL - FUTURE - DAY44Two young REFUGEES stand guard. One of them, JAMES \xe2\x80\x9cWARPATH\xe2\x80\x9d *PROUDSTAR, cocks his head. His ears perk up, he has SUPER *HEARING. He hears the distant sound of the HUM.He turns to a young woman named BLINK. WARPATHThey\xe2\x80\x99re here.Blink grabs him and WHHM! They DISAPPEAR, TELEPORTING INTO--INT. UNDERGROUND BUNKER - FUTURE - DAY55A vast BOMB SHELTER under the Kremlin. Shelves are full of food, the floor full of bunks, all inhabited by--*A BAND OF MUTANT REFUGEES. By the piles of empty cans, it\xe2\x80\x99s *clear they\xe2\x80\x99ve been here for a while.WHHM! Blink and Warpath APPEAR in the middle of the room. 'b'BLINK55They found us. As the mutants snap into defensive positions, we see a familiar face in the crowd:KITTY PRYDE. She looks toward a large mutant with an \xe2\x80\x9cM\xe2\x80\x9d brand over his eye. This is BISHOP. He moves toward her, starts leading her deeper into the bunker, as--*The rest of the mutants look up to see: the ceiling TREMBLES. Then CRACKS, spiderwebs getting wider and wider, and--*A LARGE BLACK DRILL comes through the ceiling. We hear the MECHANICAL HUM getting louder, as the drill TRANSFORMS into- A MASSIVE HAND. *The arm and body follow, dropping through the ceiling, *landing in the center of the room, revealing--A TWELVE FOOT TALL CREATURE. Black scales. Yellow eyes. It looks like a biomechanical version of MYSTIQUE. This is--THE SENTINEL OF THE FUTURE. The largest mutant soldier steps up, his skin turns to STEEL. *This is PETER \xe2\x80\x9cCOLOSSUS\xe2\x80\x9d RASPUTIN. He tries to fight the *Sentinel, but--*The Sentinel TRANSFORMS, its long arms turn into STEEL like *Colossus, grabbing him, HAMMERING him with a massive steel *fist. As Colossus falls--*Two more Sentinels drop into the room.*The MUTANTS OPEN FIRE with various powers, but--*THE SENTINELS MOVE AND MORPH LIKE MYSTIQUE, TWISTING IN THE AIR, DODGING EVERY SHOT, FLYING OVERHEAD, CHASING AFTER--KITTY AND BISHOP, who work their way through the action, *racing toward a HUGE VAULT DOOR. Kitty looks back to see--THE SENTINELS DECIMATING THE MUTANTS. *JUBILEE fires SPARKS at a Sentinel, but it absorbs her *energy, and FIRES BACK, killing her. BLINK teleports around one of the Sentinels, trying to grab it, but WHAM! She FREEZES, eyes wide. She looks down, sees: The Sentinel\xe2\x80\x99s ARM has transformed into a long BLADE, IMPALING her stomach. Blink FLICKERS, then drops, dead.2.'b'PROUDSTAR goes down. Others drop. The Sentinels take out *three at a time, charging toward--*Kitty and Bishop. They reach the vault door where--55BOBBY \xe2\x80\x9cICEMAN\xe2\x80\x9d DRAKE stands guard. As Kitty passes Bobby, their eyes meet for a moment, a bond between them, and--WHHM. Kitty grabs Bishop, PHASING THROUGH THE DOOR. Bobby fires BLASTS OF ICE back at the Sentinels, who plow through the last line of mutants. Bobby keeps firing, but--The Sentinels HEAT UP, MELTING the ice, swarming Bobby, *KILLING him. He drops with a thud, a pool of water and blood *around him, and just like that--*The room is silent. The floor littered with bodies.A mutant massacre. The Sentinels face the huge vault door. They HEAT UP, their bodies GLOWING. One of them puts a hand to the door, MELTING THE STEEL, creating a hole the size of its head.The Sentinel pushes its head through the opening, then SQUEEZES ITS WHOLE BODY THROUGH THE HOLE, slithering into--INT. UNDERGROUND BUNKER - VAULT ROOM - FUTURE - DAY66The Sentinel enters the vault to see--*BISHOP laying on a bed. KITTY sits beside him, her hands on his temples. He looks like he\xe2\x80\x99s in some kind of trance. KITTYToo late, guys.THE SENTINEL FLIES AT KITTY AND BISHOP, BUT RIGHT AS IT HITS--*WHHHHHM.THEY DISAPPEAR. Kitty, Bishop, the Sentinel. All of them are *suddenly GONE. We PULL BACK through the door into--INT. UNDERGROUND BUNKER - MAIN ROOM77THE MAIN ROOM where the mutants were slaughtered.Only now, the bodies are gone. The beds are made. The canned food is back on shelves. As if they were never here.3.'b'Off this strange sight, we--*FADE OUT.                X-MEN: DAYS OF FUTURE PAST*The black screen shimmers, becoming the blue waters of--77*EXT. NEW YORK CITY - FUTURE - DAWN 88A sun rises over the river. Buildings are blown out, a couple bridges collapsed. We see a sign that reads: RESTRICTED AREA, NO MUTANTS.  EXT. LONDON - FUTURE - DAY99The streets are empty here too. In the distance, we see Big Ben, the hands frozen, the face cracked. Military trucks (like the ones in Moscow) patrol the streets. And we continue around a war-torn world: EXT. PARIS - FUTURE - DUSK  1010*The city is flooded. We glimpse more SIGNS in French, WARNINGS AGAINST MUTANTS. A chunk of the Eiffel Tower is gone. High atop the tower: a few SENTINELS are perched.EXT. GREAT WALL OF CHINA - FUTURE - NIGHT  1111The Great Wall is damaged, defaced, like the rest of the world. SENTINELS stand guard. They don\xe2\x80\x99t notice something high overhead, a little dot in the sky. *We MOVE CLOSER to the reveal: it is a DARK STEALTH JET. *The new X-JET. *INT. X-JET - FUTURE - NIGHT*Hologram-displays flicker in the cockpit. We see a familiar *face flying the plane: *ORORO \xe2\x80\x9cSTORM\xe2\x80\x9d MUNROE. We PUSH into the back of the chair *beside her--*A device is built into the chair that wraps around a BALD *HEAD. We get a glimpse of his reflection in the cockpit: *PROFESSOR CHARLES XAVIER. We see a couple more reflections *behind him, two silhouettes looming in the back of the plane.*4.'b'XAVIER*Take us down, Storm. I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve *found them...*EXT. MONGOLIAN MOUNTAINS - FUTURE - NIGHT1212*The highest peak is wreathed in clouds. The X-Jet lands. The *door slowly opens. Storm steps down. She looks out, her eyes *go white, and the CLOUDS CLEAR, revealing they are in--AN ANCIENT MONASTERY built into the side of the mountain. *Behind her, a WHEELCHAIR hovers down. Xavier joins her. Then *the last two members of the crew:*ERIK \xe2\x80\x9cMAGNETO\xe2\x80\x9d LENSHERR. And LOGAN, aka WOLVERINE. *The four of them stand side by side, looking up at this *ancient fortress. They take a few steps forward, but--Xavier slows, tense.   XAVIER1212We\xe2\x80\x99re surrounded.And now we see: MUTANTS HIDING behind walls and columns. The faces are familiar from the opening action. Alive again.MAGNETOLet\xe2\x80\x99s see if there\xe2\x80\x99s any metal in the group...Magneto raises a hand, and...ALL OF THE METAL starts to SHAKE on the mutants, RATTLING, revealing them. WHHM! BLINK appears right behind Magneto with a sharp stick *pressed firmly to his neck. SNNKT! Logan snaps out a CLAW.*XAVIERI think enough mutant blood has *been spilled already.  BISHOP (O.S.)We\xe2\x80\x99ll be the judge of that.BISHOP steps out. The rest of the mutants emerge around him.*BLINK*You could\xe2\x80\x99ve led the Sentinels here *in that thing.*She motions toward the X-Jet. *5.'b'XAVIER*The jet is made with a stealth *technology, impossible to detect.*PROUDSTAR*Not impossible.*He detected them. Bishop steps closer. *BISHOP*I know who you are. I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard *about you. The \xe2\x80\x9cX-Men.\xe2\x80\x9d *He gives a little chuckle, looks to Xavier and Magneto.*BISHOP (CONT\xe2\x80\x99D)From what I heard, you two weren\xe2\x80\x99t *exactly on the same side. LOGAN *We\xe2\x80\x99re all on the same side now.He retracts his claw. And they hear a familiar voice:*BOBBY*Professor. Storm. *They turn, see BOBBY approaching. *STORM*Bobby. *KITTY is with him. Xavier slows, focuses on her. *XAVIER*Kitty...*He reads her mind, realizing--*XAVIER (CONT\xe2\x80\x99D)*(softly)*It\xe2\x80\x99s true. *EXT. MONASTERY - COLONNADE - FUTURE - NIGHT1313*The group now sits together. Some eating, Blink sharpening *her stick. But all of them listening. *KITTY*Whenever the Sentinels attack, I *send Bishop back a week--*6.'b'BISHOP*I warn them. Blink spots the next *site, and we pack up and go before *the Sentinels ever get close.*Xavier, Magneto, Logan, and Storm look impressed.*LOGAN*You\xe2\x80\x99re dragging people through more *than walls, huh kid?*Kitty shakes her head. *KITTY*Not them physically. Just their *mind. *She looks at Charles, who understands--*XAVIER*She projects the subatomic part of *the brain -- the impulses -- the *thing we call consciousness -- into *the person\xe2\x80\x99s younger self. *MAGNETO*Ah, to be young again.*(a smile)*This just might work, Charles. *KITTY1313*What might work? What\xe2\x80\x99s he talking about, Professor...? Xavier looks at Kitty, takes a breath. *XAVIER*The Sentinel Program was created by Dr. Bolivar Trask.*BISHOPEveryone knows who started the Sentinels.*XAVIERBut not everyone knows how it started. In 1973, at the Paris *Peace Accords, a meeting between *Trask and his associates was infiltrated by a mutant...a mutant with the ability to transform herself into anything...7.'b'KITTY Mystique...Xavier nods. XAVIERShe was captured that day. Taken to a lab where they used her DNA to develop the mutating transforming weapons that have killed so many of our kind. Kitty looks at Xavier, confused. KITTYWhat do you want me to do about it? *XAVIERWe want you to send someone back to *that day in 1973, so we can stop her, keep her out of their hands, keep the Sentinels from ever being born. MAGNETOAnd end this war before it ever begins. Kitty looks at Magneto, Xavier.   KITTYI can send someone back a week, for 1414*a few hours. You\xe2\x80\x99re talking about *decades for days. *STORM *It\xe2\x80\x99s the same basic principle--*KITTYNo, it\xe2\x80\x99s not. Going through time is *like going through a black hole, the mind can only stretch so far before it snaps. That kind of break would rip your brain apart, you\xe2\x80\x99d *be dead inside of seconds. *The words hang there. KITTY (CONT\xe2\x80\x99D)I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, I wish I could help, but you\xe2\x80\x99re asking the impossible. Nobody could survive that trip. 8.'b'Xavier doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have a response. Magneto and Storm look *devastated, the reality hitting them, but...*LOGANWhat if someone\xe2\x80\x99s mind had a way of snapping back...?They all turn to Logan.LOGAN (CONT\xe2\x80\x99D)What if someone could heal as fast *as they get rip apart...?*Kitty considers. Bishop steps up. BISHOP It\xe2\x80\x99s a risk.*LOGAN*Yeah, I\xe2\x80\x99m getting that.*BISHOP*Not just for you. For all of us. *You mess with time and space like that, start opening holes, you don\xe2\x80\x99t know what\xe2\x80\x99s gonna come through. And you\xe2\x80\x99ll be changing over fifty years of history. Some *of us could be killed, some of us could never be born...He steps closer to Logan, his eyes intense.BISHOP (CONT\xe2\x80\x99D)And for the traveler, there\xe2\x80\x99s 1414another burden. You\xe2\x80\x99ll be the only one who remembers this world, this war, you\xe2\x80\x99ll carry that with you. *And that\xe2\x80\x99s all you\xe2\x80\x99ll remember. *Whatever becomes of history, you\xe2\x80\x99ll wake up and it\xe2\x80\x99ll be like half your *life is just...blank. Gone. *They all look at Logan. The weight of that. He shrugs.LOGANWell...wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be the first time. Kitty looks around the room.KITTYWe need to vote.*Xavier reads everyone\xe2\x80\x99s minds with a glance.*9.'b'XAVIERYou just did. They\xe2\x80\x99re in. *As Kitty looks back at Logan, we CUT TO--INT. MONASTERY - INNER SANCTUM - FUTURE - DAY1515*An ancient sanctuary. Kitty leads them into the room. LOGANSo how does this work exactly? KITTYYou\xe2\x80\x99ll go into a restive state while your consciousness transfers back to your body in 1973.LOGAN Won\xe2\x80\x99t be much of an adjustment. KITTYAs long as you\xe2\x80\x99re back there, the connection stays open, and history stays open with it--LOGANMeaning?KITTYPast and present will continue to 1515co-exist. But once you wake, whatever you\xe2\x80\x99ve done to the past will take hold and become history.Xavier notices Magneto hanging back, stepping out of the *room. Xavier goes after him.*EXT. MONASTERY - FUTURE - DAWN*Magneto stands alone, looks out at the rising sun. Xavier *approaches. *MAGNETO*This war brought us back together. *Xavier slows, softens. *XAVIER*I\xe2\x80\x99d like to think we\xe2\x80\x99d have come to *our senses without it. *MAGNETO*I\xe2\x80\x99ve been many things, Charles, but *\xe2\x80\x9csensible\xe2\x80\x9d is not one of them. *10.'b'Xavier moves closer to Magneto. *XAVIER*We\xe2\x80\x99ve had our differences. But our *friendship always won out. It will *again. No matter what history may *bring. *Magneto looks over at his oldest friend, always the source of *his hope, comfort. He smiles softly. *MAGNETO*I guess we\xe2\x80\x99ll find out...*INT. MONASTERY - INNER SANCTUM - FUTURE - DAY*Xavier and Magneto return, as Logan lays on a stone slab in *the middle of the room. Kitty is preparing herself. *LOGAN*How long will I have back there?*KITTYI\xe2\x80\x99ve never sent anyone back this far, I\xe2\x80\x99ll hold on long as I can--BISHOPOr until the Sentinels find us.*Logan looks at them. *LOGAN*Great. Any good news? A beat.  None. BISHOP Your mutton chops will be back in 1515style. Logan glares at him.  *KITTY*Okay Logan, clear your thoughts. *Everyone else, back away. I need *him calm, focused. *They all step away. Magneto and Xavier watch from the corner.*MAGNETOYou really think this will work...?*Xavier motions to Logan.11.'b'XAVIERI have faith in him. MAGNETOIt\xe2\x80\x99s not him I\xe2\x80\x99m worried about. It\xe2\x80\x99s us. We were young, foolish. We didn\xe2\x80\x99t know any better...Xavier nods, but...XAVIERWe will now.They look over at Logan. Kitty puts her hands on his temples.KITTYThis might sting a little... Kitty\xe2\x80\x99s power swirls around Logan, gripping him, and--LOGAN\xe2\x80\x99S BODY GOES RIGID, HE GIVES A DEAFENING SCREAM AND--WHHHHHHM. His screams go silent. His eyes slowly open. He is laying in--1515INT. NEW YORK HOTEL ROOM - PAST - MORNING 1616Logan is now staring at a dirty ceiling. He winces, as if waking from a nightmare. He looks down at his body, wearing different clothes. A tank top, little else. And he sees: There is a WOMAN in bed with him. A beautiful if slightly trashy blonde. An old classic ROCK SONG plays on the radio. Logan rises from the bed. He stumbles to the dresser, grabs a *bottle of booze, knocks back a swig. He finds his way to the *window, opens the curtain, winces in sunlight, and sees--*NEW YORK CITY. Cars, clothes, signs from...1973. *LOGAN*It worked. Holy shit it--*BANG! A door crashes open. Logan spins to see--Three MAFIA HOODS barge into the room, waking the girl in bed. They look at her.HOOD #1 Put some clothes on.They have GUNS in hand. 12.'b'LOGANLook, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what\xe2\x80\x99s going on here, but--HOOD #1What\xe2\x80\x99s going on is you slept with the bosses daughter when you were supposed to be her bodyguard. Logan shakes his head. LOGANI didn\xe2\x80\x99t sleep with her. HOOD #2No?LOGANNo. I mean yes I slept with her, but that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t me, that was the old me, I just got here ten seconds ago. HOOD #1Really? Then what happened to your pants? Logan looks down, indeed he is not wearing pants. He 1616considers. No easy explanation. LOGANWould you believe me if I told you I was sent here from the future...?The hoods darken, the answer is no.HOOD #1(to girl)Get out of here, sweetheart. We\xe2\x80\x99re gonna take care of this comedian. Logan shakes his head. LOGANNo you\xe2\x80\x99re not. You\xe2\x80\x99re going to give me the keys to your car and some money for gas, or you\xe2\x80\x99re going to wake up in the hospital. Trust me, I know how this plays out.HOOD #1Because you\xe2\x80\x99re from the future?13.'b'LOGANNo. Because of this.SNIKT SNIKT! His CLAWS come out, but--THEY ARE BONE CLAWS. He looks at them for a second, a little surprised. But not as surprised as the thugs.HOOD #3What the hell--Terrified, the men OPEN FIRE. The girl SCREAMS, scrambling out of the room. A couple shots HIT Logan, but barely slow him, his wounds HEALING as their eyes go wide and--Logan KNOCKS the thugs back, keeps coming, finishing them *off. As the last one falls, FIRING--*Logan DODGES the shot and SLICES the guy\xe2\x80\x99s pocket, so his KEYS come flying out, and Logan catches them in the air.He has the keys dangling around a claw. His claws slowly RETRACT, the keys slide into his hand, and he looks at them: *A furry RABBIT\xe2\x80\x99S FOOT at the end. *EXT. NEW YORK STREET - PAST - DAY *Logan emerges, wearing a thug\xe2\x80\x99s leather jacket. He looks *around the street, sees--*People dressed in period clothes. A phone booth. The tips of *the Twin Tower in the distance. And he sees--*A big CADILLAC parked across the street, dice dangling from *the mirror, the license plate reads: \xe2\x80\x9cLUCKY.\xe2\x80\x9d Logan shakes *his head, knows this is his ride. *EXT/INT. CADILLAC - PAST - DAY *Logan gets in the car. He slides the keys into the ignition, *the engine growls. As he pulls away, the RADIO plays--*RADIO VOICE (V.O.)1717...the 18th MP Brigade is departing from Saigon, marking the last American troops to leave Vietnam, effectively ending the war...EXT. US CAPITOL BUILDING - PAST - DAY1818American flags flap outside Congress.14.'b'RADIO VOICE (V.O.)...the Peace Treaty will be signed in Paris in two days... *INT. CAPITOL BUILDING - PAST - DAY1919A sign reads: CLOSED SESSION. Inside the hall, a CONGRESSIONAL PANEL faces one man at a table: DR. BOLIVAR TRASK, sharp eyes, hard gaze, a man ahead of his time. SENATOR...in light of the times, we are reviewing all defense expenditures, every black book\xe2\x80\x99s getting opened, and frankly we don\xe2\x80\x99t see a need for your program, Dr. Trask.  SENATOR 2As far as we can tell, these \xe2\x80\x9cmutants\xe2\x80\x9d you describe, if they are living among us, are living peacefully. TRASKFor now. SENATOR We haven\xe2\x80\x99t had an incident in over ten years. We\xe2\x80\x99re talking about a tenth of a tenth of a tenth of the population--TRASKThat could rise up at any time against the rest of us. But don\xe2\x80\x99t *take my word for it. Take theirs. *He pulls out a thick report.TRASK (CONT\xe2\x80\x99D)This was acquired by our friends at the CIA. It\xe2\x80\x99s a dissertation written by a mutant at Oxford University. Allow me to read you a couple lines about the last time we experienced a leap in evolution...As he opens the report, we see the author on the title page: 1919CHARLES XAVIER. Trask reads--TRASK (CONT\xe2\x80\x99D)\xe2\x80\x9cTo Homo Neanderthalensis, his mutant cousin Homo Sapiens was an aberration. 15.\n(MORE)'b'Peaceful cohabitation, if ever it existed, was short-lived, followed by the immediate extinction of their less evolved kin.\xe2\x80\x9dHe shuts the report.   TRASK (CONT\xe2\x80\x99D)We are the Neanderthals now.SENATORSpeak for yourself, Dr. Trask. The Senators laugh. Trask looks at them, a beat.  *TRASKYou know, when I was growing up, I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t as strong as the other kids. They could run faster, throw a ball further. They thought they would always be superior. They had the sunny confidence, the arrogance, that comes from ignorance. He eyes the Senators, who start to sober.  *TRASK (CONT\xe2\x80\x99D)I suspect you had some of the same when you sent our soldiers into Vietnam without the weapons they needed to win the war. You under-estimated your enemy. If you do that with this enemy...(motions to the file)...it won\xe2\x80\x99t be some border skirmish halfway around the world. This time, the war will be for our cities, our streets, our homes. And by the time you see the \xe2\x80\x9cneed\xe2\x80\x9d for my program, it will be too late, gentlemen, and you will have lost two wars in one lifetime. The Senators look around, nobody laughing now. As Trask 1919*commands the room, we CUT TO--*EXT. SAIGON - US ARMY BASE - PAST - DAY2020Rain pounds down. AMERICAN SOLDIERS are being transferred home.

The Private nods.GUARD (CONT\xe2\x80\x99D)Good, just having them here gives me the heebie-jeebies. The Private pushes through the door into--INT. HIGH SECURITY BUILDING - MAIN AREA - PAST - DAY2222A dark lab where a handful of MUTANT SOLDIERS are being held. One of them has green skin like a TOAD. *ARMY DOCTORS run tests, wearing surgical masks. The Private *looks around, his eyes wide, seeing--Work stations with medical reports, vials of blood. He passes *a DOCTOR, his voice low--*PRIVATE *What is all this? *DOCTOR*Lab reports. Blood tests.*The Private looks at the intricate reports.*PRIVATE*Where\xe2\x80\x99s it all going? *DOCTOR*Same place they are. *He motions to the mutants. The Private sees a FILE with an *insignia on it, the same insignia for the guns in the future--*PRIVATE*(reading)*Trask Industries. What\xe2\x80\x99s that...?*The Doctor looks at him, sensing something off about this *guy, as--*The doors swing open. Four SOLDIERS enter, they have that *same INSIGNIA on their sleeves. They work for Trask. *17.'b'The leader is a sharp faced CAPTAIN named BILL. He nods to *the doctors, who file out. Then he turns to the mutants. *BILL*Let\xe2\x80\x99s go, on your feet, we\xe2\x80\x99re *taking you out of here. *The mutant soldiers look happy, relieved. We see a familiar *face among them: ALEX \xe2\x80\x9cHAVOC\xe2\x80\x9d SUMMERS. He steps up. *ALEX*We\xe2\x80\x99re shipping home? *BILL*You\xe2\x80\x99re being transferred to another *base. A secure facility where we *can run a few more tests. *Alex and the other mutants darken, disappointed. *PRIVATE*No, actually, they\xe2\x80\x99re going home. *Bill and his men turn to the YOUNG PRIVATE. *BILL*I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, Private, did you say *something? *PRIVATE*I said they\xe2\x80\x99re not going to another *lab. They\xe2\x80\x99re going home, sir. *Real tension in the air now. *BILL *Is that right? On whose order...? *The Private steps toward Bill.2222*PRIVATEOn yours. *With that, the Private TRANSFORMS INTO BILL. There\xe2\x80\x99s only one *person in the world with this power:RAVEN. *Everyone stands shocked for a moment. Then Bill reaches for *his gun, but she LEAPS AT HIM. They spin, struggle. The other soldiers raise guns, but--They don\xe2\x80\x99t know which Captain is real. 18.'b'Raven uses his body for a SHIELD as she ATTACKS the troops, a *blinding whirl of motion, a hardened assassin.She finally KNOCKS DOWN Bill with the butt of his own gun.

She stands over him, completely blue now. *ALEXRaven. *RAVENThat\xe2\x80\x99s not my name. (to mutants)*Let\xe2\x80\x99s go, move out. Security will be here in seconds.

I\xe2\x80\x99m on *my own. *(to the mutants)*I said LET\xe2\x80\x99S MOVE. As they move toward a back door, Bill stirs, semi-conscious. *He pulls his weapon, a prototype from TRASK INDUSTRIES. *He aims it at the departing troops. Alex is last in line. *Alex slows as he hears the weapon WHIR to life. Alex turns, *starts to generate his FORCE-BLAST, but--*WHHHM. Bill FIRES first, the gun shoots a TASER-LIKE CHARGE *that shorts out Alex\xe2\x80\x99s power. Alex drops, his body spasming. *Bill starts to power up to fire again, as--*The far doors swing open, MPs charging in. Alex has just *enough power to look at Raven and say: *ALEX*Go.  *Raven has no choice.

A sign reads: PRIVATE PROPERTY, KEEP OUT.  20.'b'And we see a faint outline where another sign once stood. The sign for Xavier\xe2\x80\x99s school. Now gone. Logan pulls up to the front of the house. He gets out, looks around. Silent. Empty. He walks up to--The front door. He rings the bell. He hears it chime off-key, like it hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been rung in years. He goes to a window, thick with dust. He wipes it clear to *get a look inside: minimal furniture, no signs of life. His *eyes narrow, sniffing the air, and--VOICE (O.S.)*Can I help you? Logan turns to see: YOUNG HANK MCCOY in the doorway. LOGANYeah, what happened to the school?HANKThe school has been shut for years. Were you a parent? Logan just looks at him. LOGANNo. Who are you?

Logan heads up the stairs, but--Hank gives chase. He CLIMBS quickly up the banister, faster, more agile now. He LEAPS at Logan, SLAMMING into him.They collide, crashing through the hall, two powerful animals locked in a brawl until--WHAM! Hank KNOCKS Logan back through the banister to--THE FRONT HALL.
